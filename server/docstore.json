All merchants who are currently participating in local inventory ads and promotions are able to create local promotions. It’s currently available in the following countries: Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the US.\r\n\r\nIf you’re interested in participating, contact us.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Cost per click (CPC) rates still apply. Local promotions must comply with all promotion program policies and are currently not available to display on free local listings.

Local promotions can be used to help highlight thematic and category-based offers—like holiday sales or discounts on post-seasonal merchandise.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow local promotions work\r\n\r\nLocal promotions function similarly to standard promotions. To create a local promotion, you can:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Use the promotion builder in the \"Promotions\" dashboard in Merchant Center.\r\n  Add new attributes to your existing promotions feed.\r\n  Create a separate local promotions feed and apply it to your locally-available products.\r\n  Use the Content API for promotions\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal promotion requirements\r\n\r\nSupported local promotion types","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\10146326.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":34}}}}],["bbf1a041-8b7d-479f-b227-6ebf455defd0",{"pageContent":"Use the Content API for promotions\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal promotion requirements\r\n\r\nSupported local promotion types\r\n\r\nLocal promotions need to be in one of the following structured promotion types.

To learn how to set up return policies for Buy on Google, check this article.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen you submit your product data to show Shopping ads or free listings, you may also choose to provide information about your return and refund policies. Return policy is a key factor for people who are making a purchasing decision, and showing your policies on your ads and listings may help the performance of your products.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tip: If you see a notation on your ads or listings that says your return policy applies \"For most items,” that means we were able to determine your return policy without you uploading it.

The return policies that are uploaded and verified will take precedence over what we've collected from your website.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nTo set up returns, you’ll need to create return policies in your Merchant Center account. Return policies can be associated with all products, with specific groups of products, or even a single product by using the return policy label [return_policy_label] attribute in your product feed.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you can share your return policy automatically using the Content API. Only people with experience in web development should set this up, but once it’s done, anyone can use it.

After your data has initially been validated, Merchant Center will continue to validate it to make sure your free and fast annotation stays up to date.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the default method Google uses to validate your shipping data for free and fast annotations is to crawl your website. For free and fast annotations on ads, you can also provide accurate and up-to-date validation data with Google Ads conversion tracking. If conversion tracking is connected to your store’s conversion data, Merchant Center can automatically validate your free and fast shipping data, potentially minimizing the need for it to crawl your store’s site.\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n\r\nIn order to use conversion tracking to validate your shipping data:\r\n\r\n\r\n  You need a Google Ads account with conversion tracking enabled.

You’re expected to provide courteous customer service responses within two business days. This means support for your customers’ purchases, returns, and questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Keep in mind: Although Buy on Google merchants are required to provide their own customer support, Google customer support agents will still be available for escalations or claims.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood customer service is a mark of a successful business. When customers are provided with great customer service, they’re more likely to return and make another purchase. In order to maximize customer satisfaction, here are some tips to help foster a positive relationship with your customers.\r\n\r\nBest practices\r\n\r\nWhen communicating with the customer, it is important to keep these best practices in mind:\r\n  \r\n  Merchants should have a valid email address listed as a customer service contact. Make sure to check it frequently and clear out the inbox so it doesn’t become too full to receive messages.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Be cordial to customers. Communicate with your customers in a professional, timely manner.\r\n  Merchants should provide a prepaid return label in addition to a RMA number and address when a buyer requests a return. Once a return is received, the merchant can approve, deny, or modify compensation depending on the item quality.\r\n  Require a signature at delivery if the product is of high value.\r\n  Include a valid reason on why the product is ineligible for return if a return is being rejected.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\10833159.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":28}}}}],["de5f9c9e-200a-4738-b4bf-94a558531576",{"pageContent":"Require a signature at delivery if the product is of high value.\r\n  Include a valid reason on why the product is ineligible for return if a return is being rejected.\r\n  Communicate to your customers in a clear, consistent, and succinct manner.

You can accomplish this by using a standardized template and by minimizing text in email signatures to prevent confusion and clutter.\r\n  Address the response to the customer requesting assistance and not the “Google Merchant Center” when responding to customer service tickets.\r\n  Don’t redirect the customer to your own customer service or website as this could cause additional confusion.\r\n  Google-facilitated communications. To ensure our Google customer support agents have insight into the full conversation in the event of a dispute, all customer correspondence related to orders placed through Buy on Google must be managed via Google-facilitated messaging.\r\n  Requesting personal information from customers is strictly prohibited.\r\n  Refunds and returns. In some cases, customers may request a refund or to return an item. You can issue a full or partial refund in Merchant Center. Be sure to also follow the minimum required return policies.

This process will help consumers understand your business, products and services better.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nRetailers participating in Buy on Google must submit additional information either when setting up their Buy on Google account, or if you already had a Buy on Google account before these laws went into effect, when prompted in your account. \r\n\r\nYou’ll find the list of required information in the Buy on Google setup page of your Merchant Center account. \r\n\r\n\r\n  Sign in to your Merchant Center account.\r\n  Click the tools  icon.\r\n  Under “Tools,” click Buy on Google setup.\r\n  Enter the required information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Not conforming to the requirements above may result in your products not showing on Buy on Google. An example of an online marketplace consumer information law is the federal INFORM Consumers Act.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n  Need help?

When you turn on auto-tagging in Merchant Center, you can:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Track conversions from your free listings and free local product listings on your website on all browsers (separately from other conversion types).\r\n  Split out performance in a third-party web analytics tool, such as Google Analytics, between your free listings and free local listings from overall Google organic traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article covers how auto-tagging works and how to enable it.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nAfter someone clicks your free listing and free local listing, auto-tagging adds a bit of additional information—a parameter called a result id—to the URLs people click through. For example, if someone clicks on your free listing for www.example.com, the final URL will look like www.example.com/?srsltid=123xyz.\r\n\r\nThe result id is created at the time of an impression. If a user clicks the same free listing or free local listing again, the same result id will be used.\r\n\r\nA small percentage of websites don't allow arbitrary URL parameters and serve an error page when auto-tagging is turned on. Check with your web developer to see if this applies to you, or turn on auto-tagging and do a test by clicking on your free listing. If the link to your site works, then you can use auto-tagging. If you get an error, you'll need to turn auto-tagging off from your Merchant Center account. Then, ask your web developer to allow arbitrary URL parameters before turning it back on.\r\n\r\nSet up auto-tagging\r\n\r\nAuto-tagging can be enabled at the Merchant Center account level by an admin. It won't be enabled by default.

Vehicle ads are in open beta in the US and Canada, and in closed beta in Australia. Refer to the “Availability” section below for more information regarding participation in this program.\r\n\r\n\r\nVehicle ads are a performance-focused lower funnel ad format, which allows auto advertisers to promote their entire inventory of vehicles to interested customers shopping for vehicles on Google. This format shows customers an image of the vehicle with important information such as make, model, price, mileage, and advertiser name. Showing inventory of available vehicles enriches the customer's purchase experience and provides more qualified leads for auto advertisers.\r\n\r\nVehicle ads help advertisers drive sales by optimizing for both online conversions (leads) and offline conversions (store visits).\r\n\r\nClicking on a vehicle ad will take the customer to the vehicle description page (VDP) on your website. From there, they can perform additional actions such as contacting the dealer, filling out a lead form, etc. before visiting the dealership. If you’re a US or Canadian auto advertiser and interested in participating, contact us here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\n\r\nVehicle ads help you get in front of auto shoppers online at the right moment, with the right listings and information to move them closer to a purchase. Key benefits include:\r\n\r\n\r\n  More qualified leads: Showing customers key information and visuals about the car before they click, helps provide more qualified leads\r\n  Omnichannel goals: Optimize for both online conversions (leads) and offline conversions (store visits)\r\n  Automated targeting: Vehicle ads show your most relevant listings for a related user query\r\n  Increased exposure: Serve alongside your text ads on Google\r\n\r\n\r\nAvailability","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\11189169.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":28}}}}],["e761097e-f6a9-465b-8138-372a1e8daba4",{"pageContent":"Automated targeting: Vehicle ads show your most relevant listings for a related user query\r\n  Increased exposure: Serve alongside your text ads on Google\r\n\r\n\r\nAvailability\r\n\r\nVehicle ads support both new and used vehicle inventory from dealer or retailer stock. Vehicle ads from private sellers, individuals, or auto brokers aren't permitted.\r\n\r\nVehicle ads may be used to promote only non-commercial passenger vehicles, such as cars or pickup trucks (utes in AU).\r\n\r\nExamples of not-allowed vehicle types are recreational vehicles, commercial vehicles, farm vehicles, buses, 2-wheelers, trains, boats, airplanes, or outdoor utility vehicles.\r\n\r\nVehicle ads are currently available in the US and Canada and in a limited beta in select countries. If you’re a US or Canadian auto advertiser and interested in participating, contact us here. For auto advertisers in Australia, contact your Google representative if you're interested in participating.\r\n\r\nHow vehicle ads work\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: All vehicle ads campaigns will be upgraded to Performance Max by September 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertisers are required to upload their vehicle data feed to Merchant Center. The advertiser’s feed must contain pertinent details about their vehicles, including make, model, price, mileage, color, and more. Google uses these details to match a customer's search to the most relevant cars.\r\n\r\nTo use vehicle ads, you must create Smart Shopping campaigns on Google Ads. All existing vehicle ads campaigns will be upgraded to Performance Max campaigns by September 2023. You must also link your Google Ads account to a Merchant Center account and a Google Business Profile. A store feed alternative to Business Profile linking is available if you don’t own or manage the profiles for your dealer locations.\r\n\r\nVehicle ads target customers at the bottom of the funnel, closer to selecting a specific vehicle, configuration, and/or dealer. The format appears on queries with a high car shopping intent.\r\n\r\nRelated links","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\11189169.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":28,"to":55}}}}],["7d0b2a73-9be7-4a0f-8764-6ee574edee10",{"pageContent":"Related links\r\n\r\n\r\n  Vehicle ads overview\r\n  Vehicle ads policies\r\n  Implementation guide\r\n  Vehicle ads image guidelines\r\n  Vehicle ads Content API guidelines\r\n  Vehicle ads troubleshooting form\r\n  Enable vehicle ads in your Performance Max campaign\r\n\r\n\r\n             Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\11189169.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":55,"to":67}}}}],["12347ba6-5e21-4f5e-924e-e041825ed3aa",{"pageContent":"Vehicle ads onboarding guideLink your Merchant Center and Google Ads accountsNext: Enable vehicle ads in your Smart Shopping campaigns\r\n\r\n\r\n  This is step 7a of the vehicle ads onboarding guide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: All vehicle ads campaigns will be upgraded to Performance Max by September 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  All existing vehicle ads Smart Shopping campaigns will be upgraded to Performance Max by September 2023, bringing you additional inventory and formats to reach new customers.

In this case, the full dealership address should be displayed when the user clicks to view dealership location details.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Display your vehicle availability prominently.

There’s nothing you need to do to sign up. Your progress will be monitored automatically, and benefits will be applied to your offers once you meet a certain performance threshold.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    The program is meant to incentivize providing an excellent customer experience—and you can benefit, regardless of the size or industry of your business. You won't be penalized if you don’t offer a certain level of customer experience or if you don’t provide some or all of the requested information. You just won't receive the benefits listed above.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle may make your offers more prominent on the Shopping tab or in promotional modules if you provide information for some customer experience areas below. However, you must submit information for all areas to receive badging on your listings. The program metric values don’t display directly to customers on an individual offer level. Instead, the program metrics are impression weighted averages, and are only displayed in your Merchant Center account.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\11192630.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":29}}}}],["e3de043c-76b1-4db8-ab3a-3c54bae2710a",{"pageContent":"Google will evaluate the information that you provide each day. Even though all metrics are calculated based on an impression weighted average, there's a fixed lookback period. So, if your rating has been in “Opportunity or “Comparable” for a while, it may take a few weeks for your improvements to be reflected in Google's evaluation. All merchants on the platform are eligible to receive benefits from the program and your performance is evaluated against all other merchants.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind: If you don’t have any ratings or if you’re missing specific ratings, this could either be because you’re not currently providing the required information, or because your offers haven’t received sufficient impressions in the lookback period.\r\n\r\nAlso, if you’re providing offer-level shipping data, make sure to include both shipping cost and transit time for each offer. Your offer-level data will override your account-level data, so the Shopping experience scorecard will use these values when determining your performance level.\r\n\r\nCheck out the Shopping experience scorecard tab to view the areas where you’re providing information and to learn how you can update missing information.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Example\r\n\r\n  Barbara’s Buckles has a blank rating for shipping speed. After a quick check, they realize that they’re providing shipping cost without providing shipping speed.

If the same vehicle is available for multiple store codes or has multiple fulfillment types, these are supported by repeated fields for store codes and the group attribute for vehicle fulfillment, and there is no need to submit a VIN multiple times for these scenarios. If a VIN is submitted for more than one vehicle offer, those offers will be disapproved in the feed.\r\n    \r\n      Exception: If you’re submitting offers in multiple languages, the VIN can be submitted once for each language (if available).","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\11192663.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":34}}}}],["f151ccff-c440-4d15-8aa3-b044758a69f4",{"pageContent":"Exception: If you’re submitting offers in multiple languages, the VIN can be submitted once for each language (if available).\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: All vehicle ads campaigns will be upgraded to Performance Max by September 2023.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild your primary feed\r\n\r\nStep 1: Create a delimited text file, an XML file, or use API\r\n\r\nTo start, create either a delimited text file (recommended) or an XML file, or use the API.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Tell us about the vehicles in your inventory\r\n\r\nYour primary feed is Google’s source of information for your vehicle ads.

When consumers find your products on Google, they see a “Price drop” badge.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nIf you change the price of your product to be lower than the average price that you listed in the past, Google can show the “Price drop” badge for this product. “Price drop” badges are designed to show only when there has been a significant drop to what has been a fairly stable price for a product.\r\n\r\nHow it shows\r\n\r\nThe new price appears as the current price alongside the original price. The original price provides a reference for consumers so that they can see the difference between the original price and the new prices (for example, if the original price was $749 USD, it appears as “Was $749” in the listing).\r\n\r\nYour product also shows a “Price drop” badge.

Provide basic information, such as contact information and location, then agree to the Terms of Service.\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Note: You need a Google account before you can register for a Merchant Center account. If you don't already have a Google account, create one here.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  Set up your user roles.\r\n  Set up your Merchant Center account. Click the tools icon  then click Business information.\r\n  In the \"About your business\" tab, enter the appropriate information.\r\n  To onboard as a websiteless store, you will need to:\r\n    \r\n      Leave the website field blank under the “Business information” of your Merchant Center account.\r\n      Leave the link [link] attribute blank in your feeds or in the content API.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  Make sure your business follows the Merchant Center guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe image link [image_link] attribute is still required for Buy on Google. If you don’t have a website, you may choose to host images on third-party cloud providers and use those links. You don’t need to own the image, but the image link must be publicly accessible.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: If you’ve claimed your website in Merchant Center before, you won't be able to remove the website.

There are several ways to verify, and you can choose which verification method is right for you. Usually, once verification is done, you won’t have to do it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Key terms\r\n\r\n  Verify\r\n  When you verify your website, you let Google know that you're the owner of the website. You're the website owner if you can make edits to your website content. If you’re not the website owner, you’ll need to work together with your website owner or administrator to verify the website.\r\n\r\n  Claim\r\n\r\n  When you claim your website address, you associate your verified website address with your Merchant Center account, creating a link between them. Linking your website address and your Merchant Center account reserves the website address for use with your account exclusively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow do I know which method is right for me?\r\n\r\nUse your ecommerce platform if:\r\n\r\nYour website is hosted by a third-party ecommerce platform. There may be suggested options for verifying your website provided by the platform. Check with your platform for more information.\r\n\r\nAdd an HTML tag or file if: \r\n\r\nYou can add HTML code to the index page on the site you want to verify, or you can add new files to the server behind the site you want to verify.\r\n\r\nUse email verification if:\r\n\r\nYou can receive a code to an email address that’s associated with your site.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Email verification is offered only if it's available.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse Google Tag Manager if: \r\n\r\nYou’re an account-level administrator for Google Tag Manager.\r\n\r\nUse Google Analytics if:","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\11586344.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":54}}}}],["bf6e1f3c-5788-4677-8c69-288d87936e44",{"pageContent":"Note: Email verification is offered only if it's available.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse Google Tag Manager if: \r\n\r\nYou’re an account-level administrator for Google Tag Manager.\r\n\r\nUse Google Analytics if: \r\n\r\nYou have administrator access to a Google Analytics account that's already linked to the site you want to verify. This method might not work if you use a third-party platform (such as Shopify). For those accounts, we recommend using an HTML tag to verify your site.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout automatic online store verification\r\n\r\nWhen Google already has the information that it needs to verify your online store (for example, if you use other Google products such as Google Analytics on your website), the verification is done automatically. If this is the case, you’ll get a notification in your Merchant Center that your online store has been automatically verified during the account setup process after you enter your online store address.\r\n\r\nYou may also receive an email from Search Console, a Google tool, letting you know that Merchant Center has created an account for you. Merchant Center verifies your site through Search Console.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQs\r\n\r\nWhat if I need someone else in my business to complete this step for me?\r\n  During the verification process, you can invite someone to help out with this step. You can add them as a user in Merchant Center, or send them the instructions for website verification.\r\n\r\nIf a user on my account has previously verified your website for use with other Google products, such as Search Console, do I have to do this step again?\r\n  No, you only need to complete this process once. Your website will be recognized as verified if any of your users are a verified owner of the website in Search Console. In this case, you can skip to the claiming step.\r\n\r\nI wasn't asked to verify or claim my website.

This account type differs from sub-accounts you can create in Merchant Center or by using Content API, where each account should only contain offers from a single seller.\r\n\r\nMulti-seller accounts are available only for marketplaces, which are online platforms that provide a place for multiple individual merchants to sell their products.\r\n\r\nIf you manage your own website and store and it's not part of a marketplace, these guidelines don't apply to you.\r\n\r\nYou need to convert your Google Merchant Center account to an advanced account to be able to create sub-accounts for each seller or leverage multi-seller sub-accounts.\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\n\r\nMulti-seller sub-accounts simplify account management by reducing the number of sub-accounts needed for marketplaces to manage their large number of sellers. Rather than having individual sub-accounts for each seller, these sub-accounts can be grouped into a multi-seller account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMulti-seller account structure\r\n\r\nYou only need one feed per multi-seller account. Individual sellers within the multi-seller sub-account must be distinguished using the external seller ID [external_seller_id] attribute, which is an external identifier that the multi-seller accounts use to refer to an individual seller. This structure significantly simplifies the setup for marketplaces and mitigates the impact of individual seller violations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: The external seller ID is used internally and isn’t shown in ads. Additionally, the seller sub-accounts that are auto-created by Google aren’t accessible in Merchant Center and are only used internally to group offers to the same seller.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional benefits:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Simplified creation and management of multiple sellers in a single feed and sub-account, as opposed to management of each seller through single-seller sub-accounts and feeds.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\11912671.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":28}}}}],["61b2cb25-9c2a-4f21-86e7-ae900821bf22",{"pageContent":"Simplified creation and management of multiple sellers in a single feed and sub-account, as opposed to management of each seller through single-seller sub-accounts and feeds.\r\n  Eliminates the need for ongoing reshuffling of accounts as new sellers are automatically created based on the external seller ID [external_seller_id] attribute in the multi-seller account.\r\n  A multi-seller sub-account can hold up to 40 million offers, without the need to request quota increases for that sub-account. Quota is still limited at the Marketplace multi-client account (MCA) level (defaults to 1 million for marketplaces). If you need additional quota, please contact Google.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsiderations\r\n\r\nMulti-seller accounts simplify operational management but don’t provide all the features and functionality of single seller accounts. If you want to leverage any of the following, don’t use a multi-seller account; instead, separate your sellers into their own sub-account:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Display the seller name with the offers\r\n  Set a different return policy for each seller (different shipping policy can be set at the offer-level)\r\n  Run seller-specific ads campaigns\r\n  Display product ratings, return policy and badging with your products\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you sell your own products in addition to other sellers’ products, use separate sub-accounts for your own products and let Google know via this form or directly from your Merchant Center account under Help  > Help center and support > Contact us.\r\n\r\nSet up a multi-seller account\r\n\r\nA multi-seller account is automatically provided when a marketplace converts their standalone Merchant Center account to an advanced account.

Once a PID is in place, we err on the side of caution and disapproves products that are likely to violate our requirements. A review is required to resolve these issues. \r\n\r\nTo help prevent disapprovals related to price and availability, you can enable automatic item updates, a feature that may reduce the risk of preemptive product disapproval for price and availability mismatches.\r\n\r\nFinding product-level issues:\r\n\r\nAll product-level issues can be found by selecting the “Needs attention” tab of the “Products” page in your Merchant Center account. All issues associated with a particular product can be found in the “Needs attention” section on the product details page for that particular product.\r\n\r\nResolving product-level issues:\r\n\r\nIt’s recommended that you fix product-level issues by editing your product data to correct the issue and then re-uploading your product data via your chosen upload method (such as a file). Each product-level issue also contains a “Learn more” link that directs you to specific instructions for fixing the issue.\r\n\r\nTo help fix disapprovals related to promotional overlay on images, we recommend you enable automatic image improvements. This feature will try to automatically fix these images by removing promotional overlays.

If you have a multi-client account, each sub-account will have automatic updates enabled (sub-accounts can also specify their own settings).\r\n\r\n In your Merchant Center account, select Products in the left navigation menu.\r\n\r\n Select the Automatic improvements tab.\r\n\r\n In the “Automatic updates” box, select Edit.\r\n\r\n On the following page, you can enable automatic updates for price, availability, condition, or any combination of the three. You can also turn off automatic updates completely.\r\n\r\n\r\nBest practices\r\n\r\n\r\n  If the price, availability, or condition of the majority of the products on your website is updated multiple times per day, then automatic updates can help you avoid errors due to the time difference between updates on your website and updates to product details in Merchant Center.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12157888.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":215,"to":248}}}}],["124eadd6-5efe-41b9-b321-4003e0f173df",{"pageContent":"If you’re using the sale price [sale_price] attribute, make sure that the time period in which the sale is active is specified correctly with the sale price effective date [sale_price_effective_date] attribute and that the timezone is correct. When a sale is active, the sale price is shown as the current price in Shopping search results.\r\n  For products sold in bulk quantities, you should submit the total price for the minimum number of products sold. Landing pages must list prices in the appropriate currency of the target country, and in the same currency as submitted in your product data.\r\n  To detect and update mismatches, Google crawls the landing pages listed in your data feed or provided in the Content API. You can increase Google's crawl rate to allow us to cover more products on your website. Learn more about how to change the Googlebot crawl rate\r\n  Ensure the info in your product feed is consistent with the actual condition of your product.\r\n  Include information regarding the condition of your products in your product data. Automatic item updates for condition checks the value you provide for the condition [condition] attribute against other values in your product data. Using terms like “new”, “used”, or “refurbished” in the title or description of your product allows us to cross-check for consistency. If you turn off automatic item updates, the product will be subject to item-level disapprovals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAQs\r\n\r\nWhat is structured data markup?\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Structured data markup is tiny pieces of product information on your website. It helps search engines read the information on your website and display it in a useful way.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12157888.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":249,"to":263}}}}],["391a1c83-9e55-4428-90ae-fe3cc177158a",{"pageContent":"Structured data markup is tiny pieces of product information on your website. It helps search engines read the information on your website and display it in a useful way.\r\n\r\n      Using schema.org structured annotations on your website allows us to reliably retrieve up-to-date information directly from your website. In Merchant Center, the structured annotations are used to update your product data and simplify the creation and maintenance of your product feed. For automatic updates, we rely on the price, availability, and condition annotations on your website to update the price, availability and condition attributes in Merchant Center.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nDo I need to set up structured data markup on my website?\r\n\r\n  \r\n    It’s recommended to set up structured data markup on your website. If your product landing pages don’t contain any structured data, or the structured data markup is incomplete or incorrect, we rely on advanced data extractors to update your products automatically.\r\n\r\n    Advanced extractors use a combination of statistical models and machine learning to detect and extract product data from your website independent of structured data markup. While we’ve designed various checks and safeguards for this feature to prevent incorrect updates, we may not have advanced data extractor coverage for every domain and schema.org annotations may be disabled if they aren’t accurate.\r\n\r\n    If the extractors are unable to determine price availability, or condition information, your products will be subject to item-level disapprovals.\r\n  \r\n\r\n             Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12157888.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":263,"to":280}}}}],["a58087c2-f9dc-4d29-ab14-4b7dda67400d",{"pageContent":"I want to add products to Merchant Center using Google Sheets\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for information about registering a Google Sheet in the classic Merchant Center experience, click here. \r\n\r\n\r\nWith this method, you'll maintain a spreadsheet with all your product data.

Can I update specific details for specific products?\r\n\r\n  Yes, you can edit individual product details, such as adding a specific attribute, using the product editor.\r\n\r\n  My products were disapproved in Merchant Center. Can I use the product editor to update the information?\r\n\r\n  Yes. If your product is flagged due to missing or incorrect information, you can use the product editor to add or update the information.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe product editor overrides any changes that you made using another method for adding products. For example, if you uploaded your products using a file, a change made in the product editor will override the change in the file.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdit a single product\r\n\r\nThe options available in the product editor differ depending on the type of store you have.

If this happens, remove the duplicate offers and use the vehicle fulfillment [vehicle_fulfillment] attribute to enter multiple store codes for the same offer.\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n\r\n\r\n  Step 1: See the affected products\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  Sign in to your Merchant Center account.\r\n  Select Products on the navigation menu, then click Diagnostics.\r\n  Click the Item issues tab to see current issues affecting your products.\r\n  Click the filter icon  to filter by destination and select Vehicle ads.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo download a list (.csv) of all affected products for all issues:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Click the download button  next to the filter button , beneath the graph and above the list of issues.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo download a list (.csv) of all affected products for a particular issue:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Find the issue under the “Issue” column, then click the download button  at the end of the row.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo see a list of up to 50 products with this particular issue:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Find the issue under the “Issue” column, then click View examples in the “Affected items” column.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Step 2: Delete duplicate offers\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Filter the downloaded report so that you only see products with:","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12161032.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":48}}}}],["275058e3-8ee9-4ac0-a4cd-80a97c01eaa4",{"pageContent":"Step 2: Delete duplicate offers\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Filter the downloaded report so that you only see products with:\r\n        \"Issue title\" = Duplicate offer with the same VIN\r\n      Search your product data for those products (using the ID).

Ads will show relevant information about your products (such as images, prices, and store names) to potential customers. Customers who click on your ads can learn more about your products before making a purchase.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Important: Make sure that you’ve added your product and business information to Merchant Center and that you’ve linked a Google Ads account to your Merchant Center account before creating a campaign. Learn more about setting up your Merchant Center account for ad campaigns\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Quick answers\r\n\r\n  What happens after I create a campaign?\r\n\r\n  Your campaign will start showing eligible products from your Merchant Center account. It may take up to 48 hours to promote your products, so you should expect an initial delay before your ads start showing to customers. We recommend that you allow at least 14 days to perform before you make changes to campaign settings, as the campaign learns and starts optimizing. If your campaign is still performing lower than expected after 2 weeks, contact support to troubleshoot further.\r\n\r\n  How much do Performance Max campaigns cost?\r\n\r\n  Your campaigns will cost you a maximum of 30.4 times the daily budget you have specified (the average number of days per month).\r\n\r\n  You'll pay only for performance of your campaigns (for example, clicks or engagements). We charge the payment method listed in your Google Ads account for your campaigns.\r\n\r\n  The amount you pay depends on many factors, including:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    How much competing advertisers in your area are spending","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12453202.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":32}}}}],["461691a4-3183-4653-a8bc-55d81cc94774",{"pageContent":"The amount you pay depends on many factors, including:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    How much competing advertisers in your area are spending\r\n    How relevant your ad is to a person's Google search\r\n    How likely a person's search will result in a conversion\r\n  \r\n\r\n  How do daily budgets work?\r\n\r\n  When you create a campaign, you set a daily budget (how much you pay for your ads, on average, per day). The daily budget can be changed at any time.\r\n\r\n  You should choose a daily budget based on your advertising goals and the amount that you’re comfortable spending each day. If you’re new to advertising, start small (for example, $10 USD).\r\n\r\n  If you have a monthly advertising budget, find the daily budget by dividing your monthly budget by 30.4 (the average number of days per month).\r\n\r\n  Will you charge more than the daily budget?\r\n\r\n  Because traffic fluctuates from day to day, Google may allow your campaign to spend up to 2 times more in one day than your average daily budget specifies. However, our system makes sure that in a given monthly billing period, you're never charged more than 30.4 multiplied by your average daily budget amount. For example, if you budget $10 USD per day, and you're charged for a monthly billing period, the maximum you would pay is $304 USD. Learn more about Google Ads billing\r\n\r\n  How does bidding work?\r\n\r\n  Your campaigns use the “Maximize conversion value” bidding strategy, which attempts to generate the most conversion value for a given budget. After the campaign is created, you can modify your campaign bidding settings in Google Ads.\r\n\r\n  To get the most out of this bidding strategy, consider setting up conversion tracking in your Google Ads account. When you set up conversion tracking, the “Maximize conversion value” bidding strategy will optimize and set bids towards conversion goals that you choose in Google Ads.\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n\r\nCreate a campaign\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sign in to your Merchant Center account.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12453202.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":32,"to":64}}}}],["6d322c52-a137-4dc9-81bb-1bb1941077fa",{"pageContent":"Instructions\r\n\r\nCreate a campaign\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sign in to your Merchant Center account.\r\n  Select Marketing in the left navigation menu.\r\n  Select Ad campaigns.\r\n  Select New campaign.\r\n  Add your campaign settings:\r\n    \r\n      A daily budget: A daily budget is a limit for how much you want to pay for your ads, on average, per day.

If you’ve used “country of sale” to select products for your ad campaigns, feed labels can be used as a replacement to continue to classify your various feeds by country, allowing you to maintain your current campaign structure.

It may take up to 48 hours to promote your products, so you should expect an initial delay before your ads start showing to customers. We recommend that you allow at least 14 days to perform before you make changes to campaign settings, as the campaign learns and starts optimizing. If your campaign is still performing lower than expected after 2 weeks, contact support to troubleshoot further.\r\n\r\n  How much do Performance Max campaigns cost?\r\n\r\n  Your campaigns will cost you a maximum of 30.4 times the daily budget you've specified (the average number of days per month).\r\n\r\n  You'll pay only for performance of your campaigns (for example, clicks or engagements). We charge the payment method listed in your Google Ads account for your campaigns.\r\n\r\n  The amount you pay depends on many factors, including:","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12499339.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":38}}}}],["32a90b6e-e71b-4c35-95bc-411d271e7277",{"pageContent":"The amount you pay depends on many factors, including:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    How much competing advertisers in your area are spending\r\n    How relevant your ad is to a person's Google search\r\n    How likely a person's search will result in a conversion\r\n  \r\n\r\n  How do daily budgets work?\r\n\r\n  When you create a campaign, you set a daily budget (how much you pay for your ads, on average, per day). The daily budget can be changed at any time.\r\n\r\n  You should choose a daily budget based on your advertising goals and the amount that you’re comfortable spending each day. If you’re new to advertising, start small (for example, $15 USD).\r\n\r\n  If you have a monthly advertising budget, find the daily budget by dividing your monthly budget by 30.4 (the average number of days per month).\r\n\r\n  Will you charge more than the daily budget?\r\n\r\n  Because traffic fluctuates from day to day, Google may allow your campaign to spend up to 2 times more in one day than your average daily budget specifies. However, our system makes sure that in a given monthly billing period, you're never charged more than 30.4 multiplied by your average daily budget amount. For example, if you budget $15 USD per day, and you are charged for a monthly billing period, the maximum you would pay is $456 USD. Learn more about why you’ve been charged.\r\n\r\n  How does bidding work?\r\n\r\n  Your campaigns use the “Maximize conversion value” bidding strategy, which attempts to generate the most conversion value for a given budget. After the campaign is created, you can modify your campaign bidding settings in Google Ads.\r\n\r\n  To get the most out of this bidding strategy, consider setting up conversion tracking in your Google Ads account. When you set up conversion tracking, the “Maximize conversion value” bidding strategy will optimize and set bids towards conversion goals that you choose in Google Ads.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGet started\r\n\r\nStep 1 of 2: Create a campaign","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12499339.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":38,"to":68}}}}],["9bff5719-411c-4b42-98d9-a30e28905057",{"pageContent":"Get started\r\n\r\nStep 1 of 2: Create a campaign\r\n\r\n In your Merchant Center account, Select Ad campaigns  in the left navigation menu.\r\n\r\n Select New campaign.\r\n\r\n Add to your campaign settings:\r\n\r\n\r\n  A daily budget: A daily budget is a limit for how much you want to pay for your ads, on average, per day.

When you use the required and suggested attributes to accurately describe your items, it helps people more easily search for and find your items.\r\n\r\n  What file formats are accepted?\r\n\r\n  You can use .txt, .xml, or a .tsv. Files can be up to 4 GB in size.\r\n\r\n  How do I add my file to Merchant Center?\r\n\r\n  When your product file is ready, you can add the file with a one-time upload or by providing a link to the file from another website.

Some manage feeds and campaigns for you, while others provide tools for you to manage your product data and bidding strategies yourself. Hybrid models exist as well, and CSSs may offer a variety of additional services. Some CSSs charge a fee per click, while with others you might pay a commission when a click on an ad leads to a sale. Combining the strengths of several CSSs can increase the overall performance of your Shopping ads.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Managed service\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      In this case, the CSS creates a Merchant Center and a Google Ads account on your behalf.

Some CSSs may also use your product data to generate leads for you from other channels.\r\n\r\n      Google will invoice the CSS for clicks on the ads they place on your behalf. The cost that Google charges the CSS will depend on the outcome of the ad auction. The CSS in turn will charge you. The pricing model will depend on the agreement you have with that CSS. For example, some CSSs may charge a fixed price per click, some a different click price by category, and some a commission only when a click leads to a sale.\r\n\r\n      The CSS typically provides you with reporting of the performance of their activities and the associated cost, potentially across the different channels they use.

Some CSSs may provide consulting services to assist you with your Shopping ads activity.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hybrid models\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      These models combine aspects of managed service and self-service models. For example, a CSS may manage and optimize your product data feed, but you run the campaigns yourself. Or the other way around, you manage your feed yourself, while the CSS runs the campaigns for you.\r\n\r\n      Variants of these hybrid setups involve the CSS creating a new Merchant Center account on your behalf, which you then link to an existing Google Ads account. This way you can use your existing Google Ads account to manage Shopping ads placed through the CSS.\r\n\r\n      Other variants involve Google invoicing you directly for ads by a CSS. This may be a more suitable setup if you manage your Shopping campaigns yourself. In these cases, the CSS typically invoices you separately for their services.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12652686.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":57,"to":79}}}}],["bcb6da83-cb85-473c-9a60-c0cb3b63738b",{"pageContent":"Some CSSs might offer additional services beyond those described above.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing conversion reporting and auto-bidding\r\n\r\nWhatever model they offer you, all CSSs have access to the same features, including conversion reporting and Google’s auto-bidding tools.\r\n\r\nIf you’d like to use conversion reporting and auto-bidding with a CSS, there are several ways, including:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Add a Google Ads conversion tracking tag to your website\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      You add a Google Ads conversion tracking tag, or code snippet, to your website for the CSS you’d like to work with.

Google Shopping bids on behalf of merchants it represents like any other CSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCSSs use a separate Merchant Center account for each merchant they represent. This allows the CSS to upload inventory for a merchant and run Shopping Campaigns on their behalf. Learn how to manage requests to link to your business profile\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: All campaigns need to follow the same Shopping ads policies and product data requirements. This means, for example, that Shopping ads need to take users directly to a merchant's landing page where they can buy the advertised product.\r\n\r\n\r\nShopping ads on Google general search results pages where the CSS program is available will also show which CSS uploaded the offer (the “By CSS” link displayed at the bottom of the ad). If users click on that link, they are taken to the CSS’s own website.\r\n\r\nFAQs\r\n\r\n\r\n  Do I need to use a CSS to place Shopping ads on the Google general search results page?","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12653197.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":39}}}}],["f5aff9a2-29a9-4aac-9e68-2cdb7c1cdd23",{"pageContent":"FAQs\r\n\r\n\r\n  Do I need to use a CSS to place Shopping ads on the Google general search results page?\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Yes, only CSSs can place Shopping ads. You can use Google Shopping or any other CSS of your choice. You can also participate via several CSSs at the same time.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Do I have to pay Google for ads placed by CSSs on my behalf?\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      No. CSSs (including Google Shopping) pay Google for clicks on the ads they place. CSSs can choose how to invoice their merchants. For example, Google Shopping generally charges its merchants based on a CPC model.\r\n\r\n      Note that clicks on the “By CSS” link at the bottom of the ads (which lead to the website of the CSS) are currently free for CSSs.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Will my products be shown several times next to each other?\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      We do our best not to show multiple instances of the same offer (that's the same product offered by the same merchant). If we identify that several CSSs have uploaded the same product from the same merchant, we will only show it once in the ad unit. In the rare cases when we cannot detect that two offers are the same, they may both show up in the same Shopping unit. The CPCs paid by the winning CSSs do not increase in such a scenario because a merchant is never second-priced against itself (refer to the next question).\r\n\r\n      Different products from the same merchant can appear via several CSSs in the same unit. For example, if a user searches for running shoes, one model of running shoe you sell may appear in an ad from CSS A while another model appears in an ad from CSS B. The CPCs paid by the winning CSSs also do not increase in such a scenario because a merchant is never second-priced against itself (refer to the next question).\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Will I end up paying more for Shopping ads if more than one CSS advertises on my behalf?","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12653197.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":39,"to":74}}}}],["5e8da1eb-a011-463e-a916-00b50dfe05fc",{"pageContent":"Will I end up paying more for Shopping ads if more than one CSS advertises on my behalf?\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      A merchant will never be second-priced against itself in the auction for any offer, irrespective of the number, or identity, of the CSSs used by the merchant. Therefore, if two CSSs place bids on behalf of the same merchant, the winning offer and the price paid by the winning CSS will be the same as if those bids had been placed by the same CSS.\r\n\r\n      The fact that several CSSs place ads on your behalf won’t mean your offers are being repeated or that Google will charge more for a click on any of them.\r\n\r\n      Example: CSS A bids 30 cents per click to place your offer.

Since both bids are for the same merchant, we do not use CSS A’s bid to determine the price of the click that CSS B pays.

Depending on their pricing scheme, they may also report additional information or share detailed bidding data. Google Shopping also reports the number of clicks sent to a merchant and the cost charged per click, together with other metrics. The European Commission requires Google Shopping to be independently profitable in EEA countries where Shopping ads are available. Google Shopping currently ensures profitability by deducting a fixed percentage margin from each merchant bid before entering it into the auction. The margin is included in the CPC paid by the merchant and is charged only when a user clicks on one of the merchant's ads. In general, we recommend that merchants compare the costs and returns of different marketing channels to assess which ones work best for them.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Where will my product ads be shown?","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12653197.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":175,"to":220}}}}],["b2aac270-e75b-4ba5-a72b-0f909bdd3b36",{"pageContent":"Where will my product ads be shown?\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Shopping ads placed by CSSs (including Google Shopping) show on Google general search results pages.

Once a CSS opts in to data sharing, you'll be able to view data going back to the date that the CSS started advertising for your domain.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12658538.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":45}}}}],["d74f74b3-d212-46ff-970c-a1d217712da4",{"pageContent":"Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12658538.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":47,"to":47}}}}],["27509ec7-185e-40ec-b9fe-419f7c4d7201",{"pageContent":"About the Comparison Shopping Services dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    If you’re looking for information about the comparison shopping services dashboard in the classic Merchant Center experience, click here. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Comparison Shopping Services (CSS) dashboard allows merchants operating in CSS program countries to decide which CSSs can promote their products on Google. This dashboard is available in the Merchant Center account where the merchant has claimed their website (under “Shopping ads setup”).\r\n\r\nOn this page\r\n\r\n\r\n  Advertise with Shopping ads in CSS program countries\r\n  Place free listings on Google in Europe\r\n  Place products outside of Europe\r\n  Use automated feeds from website crawl\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdvertise with Shopping ads in CSS program countries\r\n\r\nYou can select which CSSs you want to allow to advertise your products on Google in CSS program countries. To prevent a specific CSS from advertising your products this way, you can disable the CSS by using the menu at the far right of the respective row.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Once a new CSS begins uploading your offers, it can take up to 24 hours for the service to appear on your dashboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nGoogle Shopping is listed on your dashboard alongside CSS. By disabling Google Shopping, products uploaded via this Merchant Center account won't be shown in Shopping ads in CSS program countries.\r\n\r\nYour products may still appear in Shopping ads if there are other CSS advertising your products.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlace free listings on Google in Europe\r\n\r\nIf you’d like to place free listings on Google in Europe, you can select one CSS to submit your products for free listings on Google in Europe. Offers uploaded via a Merchant Center account associated with that CSS are then eligible to show in free listings.\r\n\r\nYou can change the CSS representing you at any point in time. Use the menu at the far right of a row to select or deselect a CSS.

Automatic image improvements are turned off by default, but you can turn them on in your Merchant Center settings.\r\n\r\nIn this article\r\n\r\n\r\n  Quick answers\r\n  How Merchant Center improves your product images\r\n  Turn automatic image improvements on or off\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Quick answers\r\n\r\n    How do automatic image improvements work with products that contain promotional overlays in the image?\r\n\r\n    Promotional text and similar elements that cover the product aren’t allowed on images, so your product will be disapproved by Merchant Center. If you turn on automatic image improvements, Merchant Center will try to fix these images by removing the promotional information. If successful, the image will be replaced and the product will be approved. If you’re not satisfied with the new image, upload a new image without the promotional overlay.\r\n\r\n    How do I check if my image has been improved?\r\n\r\n    You can see which images have been improved by checking the “Needs attention” tab in your Merchant Center account. Look for the title \"Improved image quality [image_link] \" in the “Issue” column of the table. On the product detail pages of affected products, you can see the improved image and the originally uploaded image.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Merchant Center improves your product images\r\n\r\n\r\n  In this example, the original version of the image included a promotional overlay. The product was disapproved because it didn't meet our image requirements.\r\n  After turning on automatic image improvements, the promotional overlay was removed, and the product was approved again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Original image","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12724659.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":42}}}}],["0c1b9286-0d63-4244-876b-0e071479d2c9",{"pageContent":"After turning on automatic image improvements, the promotional overlay was removed, and the product was approved again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Original image\r\n      Improved image\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTurn automatic image improvements on or off\r\n\r\n In Merchant Center, go to Products .\r\n\r\n Select the Automatic improvements tab.\r\n\r\n Under “Automatic image improvements”, select Edit.\r\n\r\n In the “Automatic image improvements” dialog box, select or unselect Automatically improve products' main image.\r\n\r\n Select Save.\r\n             Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\12724659.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":42,"to":70}}}}],["1e1141ca-3f62-4fe9-98c5-397b4900ad8c",{"pageContent":"Follow Merchant Center guidelines to keep your account approved\r\n\r\nIf you’re looking for information about Merchant Center guidelines in the classic Merchant Center experience, click here. \r\n\r\n\r\nOn this page\r\n\r\n\r\n  Follow the Shopping ads policies\r\n  Promote only products available for direct purchase\r\n  Use a supported language\r\n  Tell customers about your return and refund policy\r\n  Collect user information responsibly and securely\r\n  Follow website-level requirements\r\n  Make sure your data meets the product data specification\r\n  Sign in to your Merchant Center account regularly\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow the Shopping ads policies\r\n\r\nMake sure that the products you plan on listing comply with the relevant Shopping policies.\r\n\r\n\r\nPromote only products available for direct purchase\r\n\r\nThe products that you promote in Shopping ads and free product listings need to be available for purchase through your online store.\r\n\r\nYou're not allowed to use Shopping ads and free listings to promote affiliate or pay-per-click links to products, except when participating as a Comparison Shopping Service (CSS) in a CSS program country.\r\n\r\n\r\nUse a supported language\r\n\r\nWhen listing your products, use a language that is supported in Merchant Center.

This article explains how to set up purchase events on your website.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nTo collect conversion data, you need to track purchase events on your website. You can track these events by defining them on your website.\r\n\r\nBelow are 2 examples of how a purchase event can be sent from your website.\r\n\r\nExample 1: Send purchase event when the page opens\r\n\r\nYou should place the purchase event on the page of your website where someone makes a purchase. For example, you could add the event on the confirmation page that appears when someone makes a purchase. This tutorial shows you how to add the event to a page where someone clicks a \"Purchase\" button.\r\n\r\nPlace the event in a <script> tag at the end of the <body> tag.

Shopping ads show customers a photo of your product, plus a title, price, store name, and more. These ads give customers a strong sense of the product you're selling before they click the ad, which can result in more qualified leads.\r\n\r\nYou manage your Shopping ads in Google Ads using Performance Max campaigns, a simple and flexible way to organize and promote your Shopify product inventory within Google Ads. Learn more About Shopping ads.\r\n\r\nPerformance Max\r\n\r\nPerformance Max is a performance-based campaign type that helps you to find more customers and meet your goals by serving ads across multiple Google surfaces including YouTube, Display, Search, Discover, Gmail, and Maps. To do this, Performance Max looks at campaign inputs like your budget, your product feed, the country in which your products are available, and then optimizes performance based on those inputs.\r\n\r\nYou can create and monitor Performance Max campaigns in Merchant Center. If you want even more control over the campaign (such as bidding options), you can use Google Ads to edit the ad.

Products with incorrect or missing GTIN won’t be synced to your Merchant Center Account and are disapproved. Therefore, assign valid unique product identifiers (UPI) to applicable products.\r\n\r\n      Custom-made products, such as art or handmade goods, don’t need a GTIN.

Sometimes, when using out-of-the-box bot detection software, it could be blocking the Google StoreBot. Ensure that your product landing pages are accessible by the Google StoreBot by switching the user agent.\r\n  By blocking IP Address: A few merchants only allowlist Google search crawler IP addresses.

This is possible because the framework is deployed on many websites and can find that the IP address is browsing the web at a non-human rate.\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 2 of 3\r\n\r\nAllow the Google StoreBot crawler to access your website\r\n\r\nWe recommend you reach out to your system administrator to understand which method is being used to block the Google StoreBot and to allow the Google StoreBot to access your website.\r\n\r\nStep 3 of 3\r\n\r\nLanding pages review\r\n\r\nGoogle is constantly trying to crawl your landing pages.

For example, if you had already set up conversion tracking before installing the Shopify app.\r\n\r\nDuplicated conversion tracking can cause inaccurate report data for your free listings and ads, and can lead to problems with ad optimization. You can use Tag Assistant to verify that you are not duplicating tracking.\r\n\r\nYou can have one tag that tracks Google Analytics events and one tag that tracks Google Ads events. But you should not have multiple tags tracking and sending the same types of events.\r\n\r\nFollow the steps in the next section to check for and remove duplicate tags.\r\n\r\nHow to check if you have duplicate tags using Tag Assistant\r\n\r\n\r\n  Disable any ad blockers or browser extensions\r\n  Open Tag Assistant\r\n    \r\n      If this is your first time using Tag Assistant, click Add Domain in the upper right corner. In the pop-up that opens, enter your website’s URL and click Connect.\r\n      If this is not your first time using Tag Assistant, find your site in the list and click the arrow icon \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  A new tab will open with your website.

After you submit a promotion, processing, review, and validation can take up to 24 hours but typically is completed within 12 hours. It may also take a few hours for your promotion to go live after it’s fully approved or quit showing in ads and free listings after you’ve stopped it.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  How do I edit a promotion?","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\13509015.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":55,"to":101}}}}],["cdf51652-6f89-4a2e-a68c-7036d0a3e7bd",{"pageContent":"How do I edit a promotion?\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Promotions that haven't yet been approved can be edited in promotion builder or by uploading an updated promotions feed.

If a topic shows a value of 100 in September and a value of 50 in December, it means the topic was only half as popular in December when compared to its popularity in September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduct trends\r\n\r\nProduct trends represent data around specific products.\r\n\r\nThere are 2 recommendation tables under product trends:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The first table shows the most popular products, meaning the products with the highest search volume.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\13542370.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":32}}}}],["4da16ada-ed3c-4fbd-9cb0-ff50b5460928",{"pageContent":"There are 2 recommendation tables under product trends:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The first table shows the most popular products, meaning the products with the highest search volume.\r\n  The second table shows top trending products, which are those with the largest positive percentage change in search volume over a selected timeframe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: For both topic trends and product trends, the default setting is to show relevant information based on what we know you sell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecommendations [Beta]\r\n\r\nUsing the data in your Merchant Center account and the data we have on topic and product trends, Google may recommend creating a collection of products to promote on your site by email or with other marketing channels such as advertising campaigns.

You’ll be given a 60-day notice of the automatic upgrade through mandatory service announcements and other comms. After your campaigns are automatically upgraded, you’ll no longer be able to create new Smart Shopping campaigns.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: There is no self-upgrade tool to upgrade existing Vehicle Ads Smart Shopping campaigns to Performance Max campaigns. You either pause your old Vehicle Ads Smart Shopping campaigns and create the new Performance Max campaigns or wait for the auto-upgrade stage.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow the Automatic Upgrade works\r\n\r\nYour campaign structure and settings, such as goals, budget, bid strategy, location targeting, creative assets, and vehicle feed, will automatically be transferred to a new Performance Max campaign via automatic migration. Campaign learnings will also be carried over to a new Performance Max campaign to maintain performance. The new PMax version of the campaign will have a different campaign name (named as “PMax: <original SSC name>”) and different campaign ID from the original campaign. If the original Smart Shopping campaign name is longer than 256 characters, it will initially be trimmed to 256 characters before being appended.\r\n\r\nThe new Performance Max campaign with vehicle feed campaign will appear as “enabled” or “paused” (corresponding to the status of the original Vehicle Ads Smart Shopping campaign).\r\n\r\nThe original Vehicle Ads Smart Shopping campaign will be automatically changed to “removed” status.

Why wasn’t I selected? When will I migrate?\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Select advertisers were initially part of a limited pilot in the second quarter of 2023. The upgrade to Performance Max for all advertisers will be rolled out early on in the third quarter of 2023, with all Vehicle Ad campaigns expected to be upgraded by the year end.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Will a self-migration tool be available?\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Given the relative size of Vehicle Ads, a self-migration option won’t be made available. You need to manually upgrade your campaigns or wait for the automatic upgrade currently planned for September 2023.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Is there a different migration timeline for Google Ads API users? What should I be doing in the short term?\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Performance Max with vehicle feeds has had API support since May 2023. If you weren’t part of the limited April pilot, no action is required. API support will be ready when Performance Max for vehicle feeds is ready for all advertisers.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    Is there a different Vehicle Ads Smart Shopping campaign to Vehicle Performance Max migration timeline for SA360 users?\r\n\r\n    \r\n      The Vehicle Ads Product team is staying close to the Smart Shopping campaigns and SA360 team on timelines.

Each product has a prescribed value assigned by the manufacturer, and any other value will cause your product to be disapproved. The most accurate source of GTINs is always from the product packaging or the product’s manufacturer.\r\n\r\n  Ways to find unique product identifiers:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Check the packaging. Refer to the GTIN on your product's packaging. Learn how to find the GTIN\r\n    Ask the manufacturer. Contact your product's manufacturer or distributor to ask for it.\r\n    Search for the product on Google Shopping. For some countries, if you search for the product, the Shopping ad will have a link to compare prices. Click this link, and then look for the GTIN under the Details section.\r\n    Check ISBNdb.com or Google Books. You can find ISBN information on either of these sites.\r\n  \r\n\r\nMake sure your GTIN is correct\r\n\r\n\r\n  Quickly check if your GTIN is correct using the following tips:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Use the right number of digits. Each GTIN should have a specific number of digits, so count the number of digits for each GTIN (for example, ISBN-13 should have 13 digits).\r\n    Use numbers only. If your GTIN has letters or symbols, then it’s not correct.\r\n    Look for the check digit (or letter for ISBN-10). The check digit is a digit within the GTIN that can be used as a mathematical check to make sure the product identifier is accurate. Use the GS1 check digit calculator","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\160161.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":441,"to":479}}}}],["a03d364d-487b-4cda-b471-1dcf11ebcb59",{"pageContent":"Look for numbers in the restricted range.

We've linked standard attributes to their respective sections in the official RSS 2.0 specification to assist you in finding additional information about the components from our examples. Although we provide examples of RSS 2.0 files, we provide minimal details about RSS 2.0 itself. If you are interested in learning more about this standard, we suggest looking over this specification.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Include all of the products you wish to include in Google Merchant Center in your RSS feed, and not only recent changes to your products. If you remove a product from your RSS feed it will be removed from Google Merchant Center.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 1: RSS 2.0\r\n\r\nBased on the RSS 2.0 specification, there are 3 predefined elements at the item level: title, link, and description. Although these elements are optional in the RSS 2.0 standard, product data feeds require them.\r\n\r\nProduct data feeds also require additional elements such as price, ID, and condition. To include these elements and more detailed information about an item, we've extended RSS 2.0 by adding the Google Merchant Center feed namespace. Defining the Google Merchant Center namespace allows you to use additional elements, called \"attributes\", and increases the amount of information you can provide about each item in a feed.\r\n\r\nBelow is an example of a basic RSS 2.0 document containing a single item. The 2 major additions in this example are the addition of the namespace declaration (xmlns:g=\"http://base.google.com/ns/1.0\") and the inclusion of 4 attributes (image link [image_link], price [price], condition [condition], and ID [id]).\r\n\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n  <rss xmlns:g=\"http://base.google.com/ns/1.0\" version=\"2.0\">\r\n  <channel>\r\n  <title>Example - Google Store</title>\r\n  <link>https://store.google.com</link>","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\160589.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":21}}}}],["a0496c4a-581e-4857-bd3c-8fbb95e0396f",{"pageContent":"<?xml version=\"1.0\"?>\r\n  <rss xmlns:g=\"http://base.google.com/ns/1.0\" version=\"2.0\">\r\n  <channel>\r\n  <title>Example - Google Store</title>\r\n  <link>https://store.google.com</link>\r\n  <description>This is an example of a basic RSS 2.0 document containing a single item</description>\r\n  <item>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <g:id>TV_123456</g:id>\r\n    <g:title>Google Chromecast with Google TV</g:title>\r\n    <g:description>Chromecast with Google TV brings you the entertainment you love, in up to 4K HDR</g:description>\r\n    <g:link>https://store.google.com/product/chromecast_google_tv</g:link> <g:image_link>https://images.example.com/TV_123456.png</g:image_link> <g:condition>new</g:condition>\r\n    <g:availability>in stock</g:availability>\r\n    <g:price>49.99 USD</g:price>\r\n    <g:shipping>\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  <g:country>US</g:country>\r\n    <g:service>Standard</g:service>\r\n    <g:price>7.99 USD</g:price>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n  </g:shipping>\r\n    <g:gtin>123456789123</g:gtin>\r\n    <g:brand>Google</g:brand>\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  </item>\r\n  </channel>\r\n  </rss>\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed overview of an XML product data feed in RSS 2.0, download the example file.\r\n\r\nDownload RSS 2.0 example\r\n\r\nGoogle Merchant Center namespace declaration\r\n\r\nThe following namespace declaration is required to use attributes defined only in the Google Merchant Center namespace.\r\n\r\nxmlns:g=\"http://base.google.com/ns/1.0\"\r\n\r\nIn addition to declaring the Google Merchant Center namespace, you must also include a prefix within every attribute tag.

Usually, after these steps are completed, you won’t have to verify again.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve lost your website claim, use this troubleshooting guide to learn why this might have happened and what you can do to fix it.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The terms \"URL\" and \"website address\" are used interchangeably in Merchant Center. They have the same meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nThis process has 2 parts: verify and then claim your website address.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When you verify your website address, a user in your account proves that they have authorized ownership of the website. Verification doesn’t give Google any special access to your website. Keep in mind that only the user who verifies a website can claim it later.\r\n  When you claim your website address, you associate your website address with your Merchant Center account, creating a link between them. Linking your website address and account reserves the website address for use with your account exclusively.\r\n  Ecommerce platforms may have suggested options for verifying your website with Google Merchant Center or Google Search Console. Check with your platform for more information.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: The links you provide in your product data must match the URL, including the top-level domain (for example, .com or .net) that you claim in your account.

Google Cloud Storage is a new cloud-based storage service that allows you to store and access your data on Google's infrastructure. Google Cloud Storage is compatible with a number of cloud storage tools and libraries that work with services such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and Eucalyptus Systems, Inc.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nInteracting with Google Cloud Storage is similar to interacting with an SFTP server: you can submit and access files with a file transfer client. Instead of folders Google Cloud Storage uses \"buckets.\" When you set up your Merchant Center account with Google Cloud Storage, Google automatically assigns you a private bucket for your shopping data. There are a number of benefits for retailers using Google Cloud Storage: enhanced security, up to 10 gigabytes in size, and flexible infrastructure that can be used for other applications as well.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud Storage can be used by developers who would like to submit products to Merchant Center.

For example, if a product is listed as being \"in stock\" in your Shopping ads or listings, the person expects to be able to buy that product, and may be disappointed if it's not actually available for purchase. For these reasons, we regularly check your website to ensure that the information you provided matches the information on your website. If your website information doesn't match the data that you provide, we may disapprove your products.\r\n\r\nHere are some tips for providing up-to-date data:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Create your feed promptly after you've updated your database with the latest information, such as price and availability status.\r\n  Submit your Merchant Center product data at the same time as you update your website. For example, if you update your website every night at 2:30 AM, submit your feed at 2:30 AM. We usually update your information for existing products within minutes (see your Merchant Center Overview for details). If your website consists of several parts that are updated individually, create a feed for each of them and submit them at the appropriate time.\r\n  Enable automatic item updates. This feature reduces the risk of account-level suspension for price and availability mismatches and prevents product disapprovals due to crawling mismatch by extracting the latest product data from your website. Keep in mind that it's most appropriate for a small portion of inventory, and is not a replacement for up-to-date, accurate Merchant Center product data.\r\n  If using a third-party feed provider, pre-process the feed and upload it as soon as possible so the feed reflects changes made to the website.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\188489.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":36,"to":46}}}}],["0a91461e-007e-4c6b-9406-0aa242efbdfa",{"pageContent":"If using a third-party feed provider, pre-process the feed and upload it as soon as possible so the feed reflects changes made to the website.\r\n  Coordinate scheduled fetches with website updates. If you’ve set up your Merchant Center account for scheduled fetches, match the timing of the fetch to any regular updates on your website.\r\n  Use the Content API for Shopping (advanced) to send the most current price and availability information to Google. The Content API allows you to provide updates for individual products and update your data for Shopping ads and listings almost immediately. This occurs as soon as the product information changes in your own system. Learn more about Content API for Shopping\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProvide verifiable data\r\n\r\nHere are a few best practices that you can follow while structuring your website to allow for quick verification of your product data and to reduce the risk of product disapprovals and account-level suspensions:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Provide important product information directly in the HTTP response: You can submit price and availability information directly in the HTTP response for faster data verification. This also reduces the traffic on your servers during verification.\r\n  Use structured data markup to list the correct price and availability: Make sure that the structured data markup is displaying the price paid by the consumer, especially if it’s a sale price. Learn more about structured data markup for Merchant Center\r\n  Display only the final price on the product page: If your prices need to be displayed dynamically, don't display prices on the product page until the final price has been loaded. If other prices are displayed first on your product page, they may be interpreted as the correct price. You may use the URL Inspection tool to confirm that the product page is rendering as intended for the Shopping ads and free listings verification process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\188489.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":46,"to":63}}}}],["ac721809-41e6-42a9-9f6f-85e1ff443e2d",{"pageContent":"Remove products from your account\r\n\r\nAll products expire from your Merchant Center account 30 days after the last refresh.

To provide consistent ratings, we calibrate ratings and filter out what we consider to be untrustworthy (for example, spam and abuse) or otherwise questionable (for example, reviews that don’t indicate that a transaction took place). Google bases seller ratings on a number of sources, including:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Google Customer Reviews: A free program that collects post-fulfillment reviews on behalf of merchants.\r\n  Aggregated performance metrics from Google led shopping research.\r\n  Shopping reviews for your store domain, which include post-fulfillment comments from the various independent review websites listed below, in addition to users of Google Search.\r\n    \r\n  Note: Reviews aren't verified by Google.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  We also source feedback from the following independent review websites:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Ausgezeichnet.org\r\n  Bazaarvoice\r\n  Birdeye\r\n  Bizrate Insights\r\n  eKomi\r\n  Feedaty\r\n  Feedback Company\r\n  Feefo\r\n  Hardware.info\r\n  Heureka.cz\r\n  KiyOh\r\n  Klantenvertellen\r\n  Okendo\r\n  Poulpeo\r\n  PowerReviews\r\n  ProductReview.com.au\r\n  RA Trustvox\r\n  Reco.se\r\n  Reputation.com\r\n  ResellerRatings\r\n  Reviews.io\r\n  Reevoo\r\n  Shopper Approved\r\n  ShopVote.de\r\n  ShopAuskunft\r\n  Sitejabber\r\n  Stamped.io\r\n  Trusted Shops\r\n  TrustPilot\r\n  TurnTo\r\n  Verified Reviews\r\n  Yotpo\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Do you collect seller ratings on behalf of merchants?\r\n    \r\n      If you already partner with Google on seller ratings and require support, contact us.\r\n      If you’re a reviews aggregator and would like to partner with Google on seller ratings, read our requirements and fill out our interest form to have your eligibility reviewed.\r\n        \r\n          Note: Typically, only 1 or 2 new partners are added globally per year.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\190657.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":66}}}}],["965558ee-2e2c-4024-961d-178acfb95a66",{"pageContent":"Note: Typically, only 1 or 2 new partners are added globally per year.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRatings for your store may automatically appear without any action required by you.

You can't respond to individual seller reviews through Merchant Center. To respond to a seller review, go to the seller rating website and respond to the seller review. Currently, we don't display merchant responses to seller reviews.\r\n\r\nIf you believe seller ratings from a different store are appearing with your products, make sure that your store name and registered domain in your Merchant Center account are different from the other store on the third party seller rating websites. If this information matches and you're unable to make changes, please contact us to investigate this further.\r\n\r\nMy seller ratings aren't appearing","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\190657.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":103,"to":132}}}}],["137f6c8c-09be-4486-a8d7-edea5408f0b8",{"pageContent":"My seller ratings aren't appearing\r\n\r\nReviews aren't added in real-time, so you may notice a delay between receiving a new review and its addition to your rating. The same is true when a review is removed from a seller rating website. If you notice your reviews have stopped appearing, make sure that the store name and registered domain match in your Google Merchant Center account and third party seller rating websites. You can update your store name and website URL in the Merchant Center. Learn more about how to set up your account\r\n\r\nFor ratings to appear in a particular country, your business needs enough unique reviews for the country within the last 12 months to allow us to confidently calculate a seller rating score. The number of reviews needed can vary by merchant, but most merchants are able to obtain a rating after collecting 100 or more eligible reviews (for example, post-fulfillment reviews, sometimes denoted by websites of review partners as “verified” or “post purchase”).\r\n\r\nHow to check if you have a seller rating\r\n\r\nTo find out if you have a seller rating for a specific country, edit the following URL to replace \"www.example.com\" with your homepage URL:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Example URL: https://www.google.com/shopping/ratings/account/lookup?q=www.example.com\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOnce that page loads, you'll be able to view information about your store and its seller rating. A country selector will allow you to view this information per country. If your website domain varies by country, repeat the above step for each variation.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: If Google doesn't have information for your store or if your store doesn't meet the minimum seller rating thresholds, a seller ratings page may not load for your homepage. Additionally, an invalid URL value or the wrong homepage may prevent a seller ratings page from loading.\r\n\r\n             Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\190657.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":132,"to":153}}}}],["cfb663d2-eb7d-4f49-a064-525b816f8f0f",{"pageContent":"Multiple destinations for your products\r\n\r\nOnce your product data is uploaded to Merchant Center, it can be used in several destinations.

If your uploaded product data and website don't meet the product data specifications or Shopping policy requirements, your products or your entire Merchant Center account may be subject to warnings, disapprovals, limited visibility, or suspension. These issues can prevent your products from showing across Google.\r\n\r\nIn this article:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Product-level issues\r\n  Account-level issues\r\n  Request a review\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProduct-level issues\r\n\r\nProduct-level issues can occur if the product data you provide doesn’t match the product information on your website, if your product data doesn’t follow the product data specification, or if your products violate our Shopping policy requirements. Product-level issues are applied at the product level, so a product-level issue will only affect the status of individual products. \r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Products targeting multiple countries may receive different disapprovals or warnings for each country due to policy differences.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two types of product-level issues:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Warnings: Products that receive warnings will continue to show across Google, however their performance may be limited. If warnings aren't resolved, they can lead to disapprovals.\r\n  Disapprovals: Disapproved products stop showing across Google.

Once a PID is in place, we err on the side of caution and disapprove products that are likely to violate our requirements. A review is required to resolve these issues. \r\n\r\nTo help prevent disapprovals related to price and availability, you can enable automatic item updates, a feature that may reduce the risk of preemptive product disapproval for price and availability mismatches.\r\n\r\nFinding product-level issues:\r\n\r\nAll issues associated with a particular product can be found on the product details page for that particular product. To review all of your disapproved products though, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n\r\n  In your Merchant Center account, go to Products.\r\n  Then, click Diagnostics.\r\n  Go to the “Item issues” tab.\r\n  Sort through the list of issues.\r\n  Click View examples in the “Affected items” column to see a sample listing.\r\n  To download a complete list (.csv) of all affected items, click the Download button at the end of the row.\r\n\r\n\r\nResolving product-level issues:\r\n\r\nIt’s recommended that you fix product-level issues by editing your product data to correct the issue and then re-uploading your product data via your chosen upload method (such as a file).

During the warning period your products will continue to appear across Google, however their performance may be limited.\r\n  Suspensions: If you don't manually request a review during the warning period, your product data and website will be reviewed once more at the end of the warning period. If all your issues are resolved, the warning will be lifted and your products will show as normal. If any of the issues aren't resolved, your account will be suspended and your products will be disabled from appearing across Google. You’ll also receive an email containing all the relevant information and notifying you that your account has been suspended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: In some cases when an egregious account-level issue is detected, no warning is given and the account is suspended immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nInitial review:\r\n\r\nWhen you upload products to your account for the first time, your products and website will be subject to an initial review to ensure they meet our Shopping policy requirements. This process can take up to 3 business days and during that time your products will remain in a “Pending” status. Additional changes to your product data and website may further delay the review process. If the review reveals that your products or website don’t comply with our Shopping policies, your account will be suspended immediately and you’ll receive a notification email with further details.

Automatic item updates allow Google to update your products on Shopping ads, Buy on Google, free product listings, and local inventory ads when using merchant hosted local storefront (basic).\r\n\r\nFor example, if your most recent data feed contains a product that costs $4 USD but your product landing page lists it as $3 USD, we will automatically update the product to $3 USD.\r\n\r\nAutomatic item updates are offered for price [price], availability [availability], and condition [condition] attributes in Shopping ads, Buy on Google, and free product listings. However, it is only available for the price [price] attribute for local inventory ads when using merchant hosted local storefront (basic).\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\n\r\nAutomatic item updates leads to an improved user experience, more traffic to your products, and higher conversion rates because customers are shown the correct price, availability, and condition of your products in your ads or free listings. Automatic item updates uses offer data found directly on your landing pages or elsewhere in your product data and eliminates discovered mismatches right away. This reduces the risk of account enforcement for price, availability, and condition mismatches. If too many mismatches occur, automatic item updates will stop working and your account will be at risk for preemptive item disapproval. Learn more about preemptive item disapproval\r\n\r\nAutomatic item updates will be turned on by default in your account. If you decide to turn them off, products with mismatched price, availability, or condition will be disapproved rather than updated.

Sub-accounts can also select the option to specify their own settings.\r\n\r\n\r\nAutomatic item updates isn’t a replacement for your feeds or for regular updates of your product data. It's designed to fix temporary problems with your price, availability, or condition accuracy for a small percentage of your products. You should continue to provide accurate product data frequently as we won't be able to cover all of your products with automatic item updates.\r\n\r\nPrice and availability\r\n\r\nFor price and availability, automatic item updates uses advanced extractors to find price and availability information on a product’s landing page. These extractors use a combination of statistical models and machine learning to detect and extract product data from your website independent of structured data markup. The extractors work in addition to schema.org structured data markup and using schema.org markup is still recommended for retailers.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note that Google can't guarantee the accuracy of any updates we make. For example, we may not have advanced data extractor coverage for every domain and schema.org annotations may be disabled if they aren’t accurate. However, we've designed various checks and safeguards for this feature to prevent incorrect updates. For more details, review the section below. You may also want to review the landing page requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting started with automatic item updates for price and availability\r\n\r\n1.

Implement valid structured data on your landing pages\r\n\r\nThe first step to getting started with automatic item updates is to ensure that you have valid structured data on the landing pages for your products. If your landing pages don’t contain any structured data, or the structured data markup is incomplete, or not valid, we'll use advanced data extractors to update products automatically. If you turn off automatic item updates, or our extractors are unable to determine any price or availability information, the product will be subject to item-level disapprovals.

It isn't a scalable solution to resolve systematic account issues with automatic item updates as it's intended to only cover a small portion of your inventory. Using automatic item updates to attempt to resolve systematic issues may result in product disapproval or account-level enforcement.\r\n\r\nWe won’t be able to update products effectively in all instances depending on the frequency of price and availability updates on your website. As a general rule, automatic item updates won't be very effective if the price or availability of the majority of the products on your website is updated multiple times per day. This includes, for example, scenarios where prices are regularly updated based on currency exchange rates. In these cases we recommend that you use the Content API to update your product data.\r\n\r\nManage automatic item updates settings\r\n\r\nAutomatic item updates are turned on by default.

The status of the promotion will appear in review until both steps of the review have been completed.\r\n\r\n  Tip: We recommend that you submit promotions 24 hours before the start time to allow a smooth and timely review process. Otherwise, the promotion may be delayed by 24 hours.\r\n\r\nMy promotion has begun, but it’s still not displaying. Why not?\r\n\r\n\r\n  There are a few factors that could affect your displayed promotions:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Items in your feed are not fully processed.\r\n    The start time within the date attributes was incorrect.\r\n    The promotion_id values were not in your products feed.\r\n    The promotion_id in the products feed does not exactly match the promotion_id in the promotions feed.\r\n    Information was not submitted in time.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  Note: In some cases, unique promotions may not be visible on mobile.\r\n\r\nWhat is the turnaround time for submitting a promotion and seeing it on Google?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Submit promotions during business hours from Monday through Friday. Once you submit a promotion, processing, review, and validation can take up to 24 hours, but typically is completed within 12 hours. It may also take a few hours for your promotion to go live after it’s fully approved or to quit showing in ads and free listings after you’ve stopped it.\r\n\r\nHow do I edit a promotion?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Promotions that have not yet been approved can be edited in promotion builder or by uploading an updated promotions feed. Once a promotion has been approved, it is still possible to edit certain information using promotion builder.

When you add promotions to products that you sell on Google, customers see a “special offer” link (for example, 15% off, free shipping, etc.).\r\n\r\nLearn more about Best Practices: Setting up promotions\r\n\r\nOption 1: Use the promotion builder\r\n\r\nThe promotion builder is located in the \"Promotions\" dashboard of your Merchant Center account. It allows you to manually enter individual promotions. Use the promotion builder if you have a small number of promotions to submit.\r\n\r\nTo add promotions manually, follow the steps below:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sign in to your Merchant Center account.\r\n  Click Marketing in the navigation menu, then click Promotions.\r\n  Click the plus button .\r\n  Select the country and language for the promotion. The country you select determines the currency for the prices shown in the promotion.\r\n  Select the destination where you want to show the promotion: Shopping ads, Free listings, Buy on Google listings, or Local inventory ads. You can select more than one destination.\r\n  Select the promotion categories that best fit your promotion.\r\n  Follow the prompts, then click Save.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe promotion builder supports the following promotions categories:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Amount off: Offer a monetary discount for your items\r\n  Percent off: Offer a percentage discount for your items\r\n  Free gift: Offer a free gift based on an item purchase or amount spent\r\n  Free shipping: Offer free shipping based on an item purchase or amount spent (not available for local inventory ads).","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\4588281.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":39}}}}],["7c77d362-9933-4a50-a72b-2db19afeac67",{"pageContent":"Free gift: Offer a free gift based on an item purchase or amount spent\r\n  Free shipping: Offer free shipping based on an item purchase or amount spent (not available for local inventory ads).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe promotion builder allows you to specify spend thresholds, discount amounts, gift descriptions, and more. After you select your promotion category, the tool will display all of the applicable options for your promotion. Follow the prompts and guides to create your promotion.\r\n\r\nIf you choose to apply your promotions to specific products in your products feed, choose Create custom filters based on product attributes in the promotion builder. This option allows you to select specific collections of offers from your product feed to either exclude or include in your promotions. You can specify the items that should have a promotion applied through any of the following attributes:\r\n\r\n\r\n  ID [id] or item ID [item_id]\r\n  Product type [product_type]\r\n  Brand [brand]\r\n  Item group ID [item_group_id]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf local inventory ads are the destination for your promotion:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Provide a link to your promotion detail page during setup. The promotion link is used to verify the redeemability and validity of the local promotion.\r\n  Select your Google Business Profiles during setup to determine which Business Profiles are eligible for the promotion. You can choose all Business Profiles, or limit it to specific store codes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow the steps above for the promotions you want to create in the promotion builder. If you create promotions using the promotion builder, you can still upload promotions using a promotions feed (see Option 2 below).\r\n\r\nAll promotions will appear in your dashboard.\r\n\r\nOption 2: Create a promotions feed\r\n\r\nA promotions feed is a spreadsheet that contains all promotions you use online. Use a promotions feed if you have a high volume of promotions to submit.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\4588281.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":39,"to":67}}}}],["71cfba3a-033f-4eeb-8b0a-1e8b53bbe537",{"pageContent":"Option 2: Create a promotions feed\r\n\r\nA promotions feed is a spreadsheet that contains all promotions you use online.

Shipping services can be associated with either all products or with groups of products, the latter of which can be specified using the shipping label [shipping_label] attribute. For each shipping service, you can configure a number of settings, such as shipping cost and delivery time.\r\n\r\nIf you provide multiple shipping services for a product in the same country, we’ll calculate the lowest shipping rate for the product for a given situation and display that rate to customers.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you have one service that specifies free shipping for products over $150 USD and another service that specifies a carrier-calculated rate for all products, then free shipping would be shown for all products over $150 USD.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Before proceeding with changes to your shipping settings, confirm whether you're using the API, manual setup, or a third-party platform. Based on your selection, your shipping settings could be overwritten. For example, updates to your shipping settings made using the automated API or a third-party platform take precedence over settings created with manual setup. Item-level shipping settings take precedence over account-level settings. We recommend that you choose account-level settings to enjoy a comprehensive experience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n\r\nCreate a new shipping service\r\n\r\nThe first step to setting up shipping is to create a new shipping service. When creating your shipping service, you’ll need to describe it, define which products it affects, and specify the shipping speed and cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Note: You may configure up to 20 shipping services per country. If you add a shipping information to a Multi-Client account (MCA), then its sub-accounts would inherit the MCA shipping.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nTo create a new shipping service:","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\6069284.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":40,"to":65}}}}],["140b308e-a723-4223-ab8c-ed1d8ce662fe",{"pageContent":"To create a new shipping service:\r\n\r\n\r\n  In your Merchant Center, click the tools and settings icon .\r\n  Select Shipping and returns under “Tools”. This will take you to the “Shipping services” tab.\r\n  Click the plus button  to create a shipping service.\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 1: Service settings\r\n\r\n\r\n  Name your service. Add a descriptive name to distinguish your new shipping service from others. Each service name must be unique within the service area and won’t be shared with customers.\r\n  Choose a service area where the products are purchased and delivered. This may not necessarily be where the order is shipped from or where your business is based. The service area should include at least one country, and you can specify multiple countries for your service area. Learn more about multi-country shipping\r\n  Select the currency used in the service area and make sure it matches the currency listed in your feed. If the currency is different, your items may be disapproved.\r\n  If you participate in Buy on Google, select scenarios covered by this shipping service. A shipping service can be associated with Buy on Google items only, all free listings except for Buy on Google, or all product listings.\r\n\r\n\r\nStep 2: Delivery time\r\n\r\n\r\n  Decide if you want to (a) show custom delivery times based on an existing carrier or partner you work with, or (b) set a range of delivery times. If you choose to show custom delivery times, Google estimates delivery times on your behalf. Learn more About letting Google calculate your shipping speed\r\n  For \"Order cutoff time\", choose the time of day by which orders must be placed to process them on the same day. Also, select the time zone in which this time is calculated. For example, a cutoff time of 3:00 p.m. EST means that orders placed after that time won't be processed until the next business day.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\6069284.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":65,"to":86}}}}],["ddef1f2f-074e-41e1-b2ee-8200ffa9a109",{"pageContent":"For \"Order handling time\", enter the minimum number of days required for processing an order, followed by the maximum number of days that processing could take.\r\n    \r\n      Note: If you process items the same day they're ordered, your minimum order handling time is considered “0”.

The value submitted for the price [price] attribute must be the same as the price on your landing page and must be submitted in the appropriate currency for the country you're targeting. Affected products have been disapproved until you update them with the correct information. Too many products with incorrect prices can lead to account suspension.\r\n\r\nHow page crawling works\r\n\r\nGooglebot routinely crawls your website landing pages and compares the price [price] attribute in your data feed with the prices on your landing page or in your structured data markup (if implemented). This ensures quality and price consistency so your customers can have a better experience. When a mismatch is found between your price on the landing page and price [price] in the data feed, the product with the mismatch may be disapproved.\r\n\r\nGooglebot automatically crawls disapproved products over the next few hours or days to recheck the price. If the price on your landing page matches with the price [price] attribute in your data feed, the products will be re-approved.\r\n\r\nNote: Page crawling is subject to the server domain’s capacity. If the domain is at maximum capacity, page crawling may take longer as Google doesn’t increase page crawling rates to avoid crawl latency on your website.\r\n\r\nCommon causes for mismatched prices\r\n\r\nA common cause for mismatched prices is the time difference between updates on your website and updates of your data in Merchant Center. Google recommends that you schedule feed uploads or updates via the Content API immediately after the products have been updated on your website.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\6098334.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":15}}}}],["1c0a59f3-2aae-40cd-bc52-4b90b0866254",{"pageContent":"Additionally, you may want to verify that you have correctly implemented the structured data markup for price [price] on your product landing pages.

Provide the shipping rate that you charge individuals, rather than the rate that you charge businesses.\r\n  Deliver to a user’s address within the target country. Make sure that your products are available for purchase everywhere within the target country and you deliver to a user’s home address. There are a few exceptions to this requirement:\r\n    \r\n      In the United States, Australia and Japan you can specify that you deliver only to specific regions or postal codes.

If you manage your own website and store and it's not part of a marketplace.\r\n      You're managing sellers as an agency. Agencies are third parties that submit items to Google on behalf of individual retailers. Each individual retailer is a separate entity and has a unique domain for its website such as example.com.\r\n      You're an individual seller on a marketplace. Individual sellers should submit their product data directly to the marketplace and make sure all of their products comply with Shopping policies. If a marketplace doesn't submit feeds on behalf of sellers, sellers can refer the marketplace to this article.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Note: If you plan to upload a large number of feeds or make frequent changes to your product data, it is strongly recommended that you upload this directly using the Content API.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManaging sellers on a marketplace\r\n\r\nManage your marketplace in Merchant Center by converting your account to a Marketplace Multi-Client account (MCA). This account structure allows you to create sub-accounts for each of your sellers, preventing a seller violating the Shopping policy from impacting other sellers. Creating sub-accounts for each of your sellers also helps you easily segment by seller on the campaign side.\r\n\r\nA Marketplace MCA provides 3 different types of sub-accounts:\r\n\r\n\r\n  1P: for the marketplace’s own offers (1st party offers)\r\n  Single seller: contains 3P offers for a particular seller\r\n  Multi-seller: contains 3P offers for multiple sellers in the same subaccount\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are unique considerations for marketplaces in account structure, setup and ongoing maintenance.\r\n\r\nAccount structure guidance","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\6363319.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":37}}}}],["7690e8f4-b2da-467c-ba48-b4c010c4a4c2",{"pageContent":"There are unique considerations for marketplaces in account structure, setup and ongoing maintenance.\r\n\r\nAccount structure guidance\r\n\r\n\r\n  Create a Marketplace MCA per region and be sure to claim and verify your domain.

We’ll ask you to fix errors if they're affecting a high percentage of your inventory.\r\n    Missing inventory data: The products missing inventory in the \"Diagnostics\" page should be present in your local product inventory feed. If your website meets the pickup later requirements and the products missing inventory can be shipped to your stores, you can add them to the inventory feed to advertise them as local products on Google.\r\n      \r\n        If the products missing inventory aren't intended to be shown on Google, you can use the excluded destination [excluded_destination] attribute.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n4.3 Request inventory verification\r\n\r\n\r\n  Inventory verification is the process Google uses to make sure that data you submit in your feed matches the inventory actually available in your stores.\r\n\r\n  To start the process, use the following steps:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Sign in to your Merchant Center account.\r\n    Click Overview in the navigation window.\r\n    Click Continue next to “Local inventory ads” or “Free local product listings”.\r\n    Find the relevant country’s program bar.\r\n    Click on the Request verification button.\r\n  \r\n\r\n4.4 Complete inventory verification\r\n\r\n\r\n  Once you request inventory verification, Google kicks off the review process, which follows these general steps:","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7022488.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":37,"to":73}}}}],["fb315e5f-d366-48dd-8d2f-ac611f62c092",{"pageContent":"4.4 Complete inventory verification\r\n\r\n\r\n  Once you request inventory verification, Google kicks off the review process, which follows these general steps:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Review feeds: Google reviews your submitted feeds.

The ID you choose identifies the promotion and is used to track the product's performance history in Merchant Center and Google Ads.

For example:\r\n    \r\n      Don’t reuse an ID for different promotions in the same target country or language.\r\n      Don’t recycle an ID for new promotions. Even if you’re not running a promotion anymore, don't use that promotion's ID for any other promotion. Assign a unique ID for a new promotion.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  Avoid white space. Consecutive white spaces and white spaces before and after the ID will be automatically removed.\r\n  Use casing to make IDs unique if needed.

This check will happen regularly to make sure the most up-to-date information is being shown.\r\n\r\nThis article explains some tips for keeping your product data and your landing page in sync.\r\n\r\nHelp us validate the data on your landing page\r\n\r\nHere are some ways to make it easy to validate the data on your landing page:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Use structured data markup. You can use structured data to indicate how elements on your landing page correspond with attributes in the product data specification. That way Google can correctly verify your product data based on the value of those elements. Having structured data is also recommended when using automatic item updates which help keep your site and Merchant Center product data in sync and avoid your products being disapproved. Learn more about microdata\r\n  Ensure your landing page is available. If your landing page is unavailable when Google checks it, then your product will be disapproved. If you know your landing page will be unavailable at a certain time, then follow the steps explained in best practices for landing page maintenance or a planned site outage\r\n  Allow Google crawlers to access your page. Google uses crawlers to read the data on your landing page. Make sure these crawlers can access your landing page by allowing them in your site's robots.txt file. Learn more about Google crawlers\r\n  Ensure that you're not restricting your crawl rate. In Google Search Console, you can limit the rate at which Google crawls your site. If you've limited this rate, Google may have trouble crawling your landing page and images. To help ensure that Google can crawl your site, set the Googlebot crawl rate to \"Let Google optimize for my site\".

With this feature, if Google notices that your product data doesn't match your landing page, your product data will be updated automatically and your ads and free listings will show the correct information. Even with this feature enabled, you'll still need to continue to resubmit your product data regularly. Learn more about enabling automatic item updates\r\n\r\nHere are some tips to make sure that your landing page is set up correctly:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Use structured data. Structured data markup is recommended to set up automatic updates because it tells us how the data you submitted corresponds with your price [price] and availability [availability] attributes. Learn more about microdata\r\n  Use valid HTML. Google also detects the price that you're displaying based on the structure of your landing page. Using valid HTML helps ensure that we detect the correct price. Keep in mind that even with valid HTML, you must still use microdata to enable automatic item updates. Use the W3C validation service to check your HTML\r\n\r\n\r\nKeep ads and free listings live during big events\r\n\r\nIf you're releasing a new product, you want to make sure that your product gets approved during or soon after the announcement. Also, during big sales, such as Black Friday in the US, the price and availability of your products might change frequently, sometimes multiple times per day. Make sure that your product data and landing page show the same information to prevent disapprovals.\r\n\r\nHere are some tips for managing your product data during these big events:","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7050465.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":18,"to":33}}}}],["76b5c548-9b98-4573-80e0-365e6c0bf4c6",{"pageContent":"Here are some tips for managing your product data during these big events:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Enable automatic item updates. Automatic item updates will help you avoid disapproval when the price or availability on your landing page is different from the values you submitted in Merchant Center. However, don't use this feature as your main method of updating your product data. These updates only happen when Google crawls your landing page, and you still need to resubmit your product data regularly. Learn more about enabling automatic item updates\r\n  Ensure that your product identifiers are accurate. Unique product identifiers, especially GTINs, can make your ads and listings richer and easier for customers to find. If you use incorrect identifiers, your ads and listings may be disapproved or they may not show for the right searches. Learn more about unique product identifiers\r\n  Avoid sudden structural changes to your website. Google crawls your landing page to gather information such as price and availability. If you perform large scale changes to the structure of your page you might experience product disapprovals if certain product details can't be verified. Avoid changes such as:\r\n    \r\n      Moving the location of price information within the source code of your landing page\r\n      Using JavaScript or other animations to display prices or price reductions\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  Don't change the ID [id] attribute of a product. If you change the ID of a product, it will be treated like a new product. The product will need to be approved to show in ads and listings again, which could take up to 3 business days. Also, information about how the product performed in the past won't be associated with this new product.

If you use non-commercial shipping rates (often called retail), you’ll likely need to adjust the rates up by 50–60%.\r\n\r\n    If you have a contract with the carrier, then you might need to adjust your rates up or down (using a negative number like -10) by a percentage or flat amount.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Subtables and complex shipping models","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7050921.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":251,"to":311}}}}],["86222cdc-4d42-419f-9dbf-ffb36436fe39",{"pageContent":"Subtables and complex shipping models\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Use a subtable if your shipping is based on 3 or more dimensions.

Transit time labels help give your customers a more accurate estimated delivery date, which can help influence their purchase decision. For example, you could add the transit time label \"heavy\" to items with higher shipping costs due to their weight. Learn more about transit time labels\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Oversize and freight shipping (LTL)\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Carriers have limits on how large or how heavy a package can be. Larger products are normally shipped using freight shipping. Freight carriers aren't supported by the carrier rate feature, so if your product is too big to ship through common shipping carriers, you’ll need to manually set up a rate table.\r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Note: This only applies to Shopping ads and free listings. LTL (less than truckload) and freight shipping aren't currently allowed for Buy on Google.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    Here are some tips for setting up freight shipping:\r\n\r\n    \r\n      Tag oversized or heavy products with the shipping label attribute. With the shipping label [shipping_label] attribute, you can give oversized products a label (for example, oversized) and specify special shipping for those products. For example, you could add a shipping label for common freight classes.\r\n      Add rates based on weight and destination using tables and shipping groups. It’s easiest to split up complicated shipping settings, either by using subtables or shipping groups.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7050921.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":355,"to":378}}}}],["6e1eaabd-a75c-4602-ae64-44a29109cca5",{"pageContent":"Add rates based on weight and destination using tables and shipping groups. It’s easiest to split up complicated shipping settings, either by using subtables or shipping groups.\r\n        \r\n          Base rates on shipping labels. Using shipping labels, you can create different rate tables for different product groups by creating shipping groups. For example, you could use the shipping label [shipping_label] attribute to indicate a freight class for each product. Then create a group for each label such as one group for Class 70 and another for Class 100.\r\n          Base rates on weight and location. If you don’t want to use shipping labels, you can link subtables for different weight classes with different rates for each state or group of postal codes.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n      Overestimate the cost. If you can’t provide an accurate cost, then overestimate. Your products won’t be disapproved for providing a higher shipping cost than what your website states. If you provide a lower cost than the one listed on your website, your products will be disapproved.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    Learn more about setting up shipping settings\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHoliday shipping cut-off (available for US and France, for US holidays only)\r\n\r\n  \r\n    The holiday shipping cut-off setting allows you to submit temporary deadlines if you have special delivery settings for a particular holiday, like Christmas or Mother’s Day.

When you set this deadline in Merchant Center, text will be displayed that tells customers their order will arrive by December 24. That text will stop showing shortly after your cut-off (in this example, the text would stop displaying on December 15 after 2:00 PST).\r\n      \r\n    \r\n\r\n    Holiday shipping cutoff will override all other estimated delivery date logic, so it's important to select a deadline that provides you enough time to guarantee delivery on all orders placed before the cutoff. If, for example, the Christmas order deadline is set for December 24, items ordered up to that day will be guaranteed to arrive by Christmas.

To understand what tax rate you should charge, consult your tax advisor.\r\n  Use the same tax rate in your product data as on your checkout pages.

In Merchant Center, you can enter a custom rate for all sales made to a state, which you may want to consider for these states.\r\n  Destination-based states charge tax based on the destination of the buyer within the state. In Merchant Center, you can select the Google determined rate option, which you may want to consider for these states. In addition, if you sell products in a home rule state, selecting the Google determined tax allows you to manually apply these tax rates to specific cities and counties.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsult your tax advisor to understand how taxes are collected for a specific state.\r\n\r\nTypes of tax settings (US only)\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to set up tax is to use the tax settings in Merchant Center, where you can set up tax rates for each state. You can also override taxes for each product by specifying it in your product data. Whichever method you choose, you’ll need to match the rate that you collect on sales.\r\n\r\nWhen setting up rates, you have several options. Depending on your goals, you’ll probably want to use a combination of these options. Consult your tax advisor to understand what tax rate you should charge.

This may be especially valuable to you if you sell and ship products to multiple countries, but your website doesn’t have different product pages for each country’s currency. Currency conversion is automatically enabled in all Merchant Center accounts. Just submit the products and prices you use on your website, and the tool will estimate the currency conversion in the ads for you.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Currency conversion is currently unavailable in South Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article covers how currency conversion works.\r\n\r\nOn this page\r\n\r\n\r\n  Benefits\r\n  How it works\r\n  Policy and requirements\r\n  Compatibility\r\n  Available features\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\n\r\n\r\n  Automatically show ads for your products in another country without making changes to your website. If you don’t support the target country currency, currency conversion may help you broaden your reach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nCurrency conversion automatically converts the price in your product data to the currency of the new target country and displays both prices in your ads and free product listings. This makes your ads and listings understandable to users in other countries while allowing you to continue using your existing website and landing pages with minimal changes.\r\n\r\nIf you provide prices in a currency different from the currency of the target country in your campaign, the prices will automatically be converted and shown in the local currency.\r\n\r\nThe converted price estimate shown in your ad or listing is based on exchange rates from Google Finance.\r\n\r\nWhile your currency will be converted in your ads and listings, to target a new country, you’ll still need to meet the language requirements for that country. Keep in mind that you'll also need to update your shipping to match shipping requirements for your target country.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7055540.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":37}}}}],["9af9a511-b5e5-4e50-bec1-8211e6e5875f",{"pageContent":"Since your website charges in your existing currency, the final purchase price for the user depends on the exchange rates used by the user's credit card or other payment service provider. This means that the estimate and the final purchase price may be different. Make sure to clearly indicate the price in the original currency throughout your landing pages and website.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Example\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Matilda's store is based in the US, and her website shows prices for her products in USD. She uses Shopping ads to advertise in the US, so the prices in her product data are in USD. She also sells and ships to Canada, but her website doesn't show prices in CAD.\r\n\r\n    But with currency conversion, Matilda can use her US product data and landing pages, which show prices in USD, to advertise in Canada. After she submits the product data, she creates a new Shopping campaign in her Google Ads account. She now has 2 campaigns, one for the US and one for Canada, and she's using the same landing pages and essentially the same product data to do it.\r\n\r\n    In Matilda's Canada campaign, her ads show product prices in CAD, with USD listed secondarily. These converted prices help potential customers in Canada understand the product and price in their own, familiar currency. When a user clicks an ad, they see Matilda's landing page with the price in USD and can complete the checkout process clearly informed about the cost in their own currency.\r\n\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPolicy and requirements\r\n\r\nSince users see your ads and free listings with a different currency than their own, they may assume that they’re making purchases from a merchant in a different country. To make sure the experience is consistent, you must follow the price and tax requirements of the country that the currency in your product data is local to.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7055540.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":39,"to":58}}}}],["244bd67c-6b97-43b5-b6ec-0fe6e6ddb277",{"pageContent":"For example, if your product data is submitted in USD and your website charges in USD you must follow the price and tax requirements of the United States.

Square images don’t need to include the brand name. For wide rectangular logos, your image should include a brand title or name that makes it easy for a user to identify your store name.\r\n\r\nUpload a new logo\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sign in to your Merchant Center account.\r\n  In your Merchant Center account, click Business information, then click Branding.\r\n  Find the requirements, max file size, and dimensions for the logo shape of your choice on the right side of the page (either square or rectangle). If your image doesn't fit into either set of these requirements, it won't upload and you'll receive an error message.\r\n  You can either drag and drop your image file from another window onto the logo shape of your choice, or hover your mouse over the box and click Upload to browse your computer for the file.\r\n\r\n\r\nPreview or remove a logo\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sign in to your Merchant Center account.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7059936.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":34}}}}],["0ae00285-3bc3-4e61-8444-547c553f8b47",{"pageContent":"Preview or remove a logo\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sign in to your Merchant Center account.\r\n  In your Merchant Center account, click the Tools and settings menu.\r\n  Under the “Tools” section, click Business information.\r\n  Select Branding.\r\n  Hover your mouse over the logo.\r\n    \r\n      To preview the logo, click Preview.\r\n      To remove the logo, click Remove.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nChange a logo\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sign in to your Merchant Center account.\r\n  In your Merchant Center account, click the Tools and settings menu.\r\n  Under the “Tools” section, click Business information.\r\n  Click on the Branding tab.\r\n  Find the requirements, max file size, and dimensions for the logo shape of your choice on the right side of the page (either square or rectangle).

Some products that are shown in beta countries may not be eligible to show everywhere.\r\n  It’s recommended that retailers who use Performance Max in beta countries set a target ROAS value to ensure consistent performance while traffic is being ramped up. If you're using Performance Max in a beta target country and have an existing Display remarketing campaign, we recommend keeping that campaign active. Your Display remarketing and Performance Max will run in parallel as traffic in beta countries ramps up.\r\n\r\n\r\nTarget countries\r\n\r\nYou can show products in the following beta countries:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Target country\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Algeria\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Angola\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Bangladesh\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Cambodia\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Cameroon\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Costa Rica\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Côte d'Ivoire\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Dominican Republic","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7101265.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":58}}}}],["9f9b0f2b-6dd0-487e-b990-d590a88e949a",{"pageContent":"Bangladesh\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Cambodia\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Cameroon\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Costa Rica\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Côte d'Ivoire\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Dominican Republic\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      El Salvador\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Ethiopia\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Ghana\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Guatemala\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Kenya\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Madagascar\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Mauritius\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Morocco\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Mozambique\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Myanmar (Burma)\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Nepal\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Nicaragua\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Nigeria\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Pakistan\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Panama\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Puerto Rico\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Saudi Arabia\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Senegal\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Sri Lanka\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Tanzania\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Tunisia\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Uganda\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Ukraine\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Venezuela\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Zambia\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Zimbabwe\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7101265.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":58,"to":158}}}}],["957fc867-a945-45a6-b912-0a703efbd170",{"pageContent":"Integration guideOptional: Integrate the badge code\r\n\r\nThe Google Customer Reviews (GCR) badge code is the first of two code snippets that you implement for Google Customer Reviews integration.

This type of software is considered harmful for the user because it may steal personal and financial information, is typically not easy to uninstall or remove, may change browser settings, and may transmit data to and from other external entities without the user's consent.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7125797.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":19,"to":38}}}}],["27c13ec9-7d1a-46d0-8b96-975b2a5e81c7",{"pageContent":"Participant privacy practices\r\n\r\nParticipants must post a privacy policy which accurately discloses their practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information, including personally-identifiable information.\r\n\r\nParticipants should include the following information in their privacy policies:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Third party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve the badge on your website and to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website\r\n  Users may opt out of Google's use of cookies to serve ads based on a user's prior visits to your website by visiting the Google advertising opt-out page.

From your reporting, identify the variants that you sell at least one item of per month, and submit those in your product data. You can also download a report with impression and click information in your Google Ads account. Learn more about how to Monitor and optimize your Shopping campaigns.\r\n  Submit different types of variants, so customers can discover each customization option. This way, even if you don't submit all configurations, you'll show different possibilities that might appeal to different people searching online. For example, imagine you sell custom-built shades that come in 8 sizes, 10 materials, 10 patterns, and 15 colors. Submit variants so that each size, material, pattern, and color are mentioned at some point, but do not submit all 12,000 combinations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInclude customizations in titles, descriptions, and images\r\n\r\n\r\n  Include \"custom\" or \"personalized\" near the beginning of the title. This extra text can help match your ads and free listings to more relevant searches. Otherwise, you might see wasted clicks from people expecting to find simple, standard products. Add this text toward the beginning of your title so that it doesn't get cut off.\r\n  Reflect what you're selling with the image, title, and description. If you're selling a part of a built-to-order product instead of the complete product, explain this clearly in the title and description. Also, submit an image of the part, or highlight areas of the image to make it clear that you're selling only one part.\r\n  Reflect the price for customized products in images. If you submit an image or title that represents a customized product, be sure that the price submitted in your feed reflects the price of the customized product.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Example 1","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7162856.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":64,"to":85}}}}],["69272f40-5fc3-4c2a-abff-d721876da453",{"pageContent":"Example 1\r\n\r\n  Imagine you sell custom engagement rings.

Learn more about the Content API for Shopping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tip\r\n\r\n  Sometimes the price of a single product can change based on the customization options that customers choose. If certain options are more expensive than others, use the title [title] and other attributes to specify which option you're promoting. Also, submit a link that shows that option pre-selected.\r\n\r\n  For example, imagine you sell custom phone cases. A white phone case costs \"$15.00 USD\" and all colored phone cases cost \"$18.00 USD\". If you submit \"$15.00 USD\" for the price [price] attribute, then include \"white\" in the color [color] and title [title] attributes, show a white case on the image, and link to the white option on your landing page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow the requirements for product identifiers\r\n\r\nBrand names together with the global product codes Global Trade Item Number (GTIN) and Manufacturer Part Number (MPN) allow us to correctly identify an individual product or product variant. You can submit these through the brand [brand], GTIN [gtin], and MPN [mpn] attributes. Although these codes are required for most products, custom goods or one-of-a-kind products usually won't have unique product identifiers.

The word \"subscription\" and the subscription duration can appear anywhere in the value for the title [title] attribute.

You can also view your daily metrics under the “Today’s Snapshot” feature in the Overview dashboard.\r\n\r\nDetailed view\r\n\r\nA detailed view has a bigger chart at the top, a table with the data in the chart below it and, if available, segmented views on the data.\r\n\r\nData in the tables can be sorted by clicking on the headers. If time comparison is active, columns can be expanded by clicking on the <> icons, which include:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The value of that metric in the corresponding previous period\r\n  The absolute change\r\n  The percentage change","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7190970.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":40}}}}],["c7092ece-eeb3-46c0-8c29-36adb399dd2b",{"pageContent":"The value of that metric in the corresponding previous period\r\n  The absolute change\r\n  The percentage change\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can sort these columns to present your data differently by clicking the column header.

Opportunities shows you cards with customized recommendations based on your current Merchant Center product data and campaigns in Google Ads.\r\n\r\nThis article explains how Opportunities works and how to use it.\r\n\r\nHow Opportunities works\r\n\r\nOpportunities uses your account's performance history, your campaign settings, and trends across Google to automatically generate recommendations that could improve your performance. Opportunities is different from Diagnostics. Whereas Diagnostics shows you product offers that have received warnings or disapprovals, Opportunities shows you products that are likely to yield measurable traffic increases if you take action.\r\n\r\nOpportunities shows you which products to prioritize making changes to in order to show your ad or free listing to more people, or how to spend more efficiently in your campaigns. For example, you might see a card that estimates an additional 500 clicks if you add a missing image.\r\n\r\nEach card gives you estimated impact metrics and information for applying the opportunity. On every opportunity card, you’ll see:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Estimated increase in weekly clicks:This shows the number of additional weekly clicks the affected products could receive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Weekly predicted click estimates are calculated using past performance of your affected products and similar products that are currently available on Google. A product may be considered similar if it has a matching GTIN, a related product title, a similar Google product category, or other similar identifying data. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Estimated effort: The approximate amount of effort involved in addressing the opportunity.

Your costs could fluctuate by this amount. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that the actual impact metrics may be different than the estimates because of changes in Google Ads campaign settings, budgets, bids, the market and auction, or seasonality. \r\n\r\nWhen you click View opportunity on the card, you’ll see: \r\n\r\n\r\n  A list of affected products or campaigns. For some opportunities, you’ll see a list of the top 15 affected products, including the estimated increase in weekly clicks per product after you fix the issue. For others, you’ll see a list of affected campaigns. \r\n  Date the opportunity was generated: You can see how long ago the opportunity was updated, down to the hour. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe cards you see are updated several times per day.

Learn more about data feeds\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nSometimes you may want to submit multiple values for an attribute. For example, to submit shipping costs for multiple areas using the shipping [shipping] attribute, you need to submit a different value for each area.\r\n\r\nExactly how this process works is different depending on the format of your product data.\r\nText feed: Google Sheets\r\n\r\n\r\n  If you submit your product data through Google Sheets, you have 2 options: separate each value with a comma or create multiple columns (one for each value). Here's what those options look like.\r\n\r\n  Option 1: Separate each value with a comma in Google Sheets\r\n\r\n  Add each value to the same cell, but separate them with a comma ( , ) and do not add a space.

Markup is an HTML tag annotation that lets search engine crawlers and bots know there is product data on your site and helps the systems reliably understand the data.\r\n\r\nIn order for Google’s crawler to match the structured data to your product data, one of the two following conditions must be satisfied:\r\n\r\n\r\n  There is a single offer on the landing page\r\n  If there are multiple offers on the whole page, each offer present on the page is annotated with a SKU or a GTIN and the respective offer in your product data on Shopping has the same SKU (ID [id] attribute) or GTIN (GTIN [gtin] attribute). This can be useful if you show multiple variants of the same product (for example, different sizes or colors, or related products) on the same landing page.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf at least one of these conditions isn’t met, the products on your landing page won’t match your product data.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7331077.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":32}}}}],["512c16c9-0fd9-49ba-8bd1-a7a5b9193187",{"pageContent":"If at least one of these conditions isn’t met, the products on your landing page won’t match your product data.\r\n\r\nFor more in-depth information about setting up structured data markups on your website, please visit schema.org’s Getting started guide. The schema.org section on machine-understandable versions of information provides help on understanding and clarifying your structured data.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdd structured data markup\r\n\r\nTo add structured data markup to your site, we recommend you add this as JSON-LD to your HTML markup. Refer to Introduction to structured data markup in Google Search for more information.\r\n\r\nJSON-LD markup is distinct from any user-facing code, which makes it easier to maintain. Any structured data markup specifically designed for Google use can be added without changing any of the visual elements of your site.\r\n\r\nIf you use an e-commerce platform on your site, you may need to make some changes to the platform template or code before adding your structured data. In addition, your site should be able to support JavaScript for template and page level applications.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tip: The code that generates your structured data needs to be kept in sync with any changes to the user-facing elements on your site.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Example\r\n\r\n  \r\n    JSON-LD\r\n\r\n    {\r\n\r\n      \"@context\": \"https://schema.org/\",\r\n\r\n      \"@type\": \"Product\",\r\n\r\n      \"sku\": \"trinket-12345\",\r\n\r\n      \"image\": \"https://www.example.com/trinket.jpg\",\r\n\r\n      \"name\": \"Nice trinket\",\r\n\r\n      \"description\": \"Trinket with clean lines\",\r\n\r\n      \"gtin\": \"12345678901234\",\r\n\r\n      \"brand\": {\r\n\r\n        \"@type\": \"Brand\",\r\n\r\n        \"name\": \"MyBrand\"\r\n\r\n      },\r\n\r\n      \"offers\": {\r\n\r\n        \"@type\": \"Offer\",\r\n\r\n        \"url\": \"http://www.example.com/trinket_offer\",\r\n\r\n        \"itemCondition\": \"https://schema.org/NewCondition\",\r\n\r\n        \"availability\": \"https://schema.org/InStock\",\r\n\r\n        \"price\": \"39.99\",\r\n\r\n        \"priceCurrency\": \"USD\"\r\n\r\n      }","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7331077.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":32,"to":93}}}}],["44249d0c-ded2-4ba2-95ea-cc31976fa4f2",{"pageContent":"\"itemCondition\": \"https://schema.org/NewCondition\",\r\n\r\n        \"availability\": \"https://schema.org/InStock\",\r\n\r\n        \"price\": \"39.99\",\r\n\r\n        \"priceCurrency\": \"USD\"\r\n\r\n      }\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAdded structured data markups can appear anywhere in the HTML source. Any added markups must be present in the HTML returned from the web server, and can’t be generated after a page has been loaded using JavaScript.\r\n\r\n\r\nProducts and Offers\r\n\r\nYour landing pages should contain a Product object, which describes the product, and a nested Offer object in the offers field, which describes how this product is sold.\r\n\r\nNote that the price must be specified with a period as a decimal separator, instead of a comma. If you show the price in multiple currencies on the landing page, you can use multiple objects of type Offer. When you use multiple Offer objects, you’ll also need to use the priceCurrency attribute to specify currencies.\r\n\r\nIf a sales price is shown on the landing page and this price is what a user would actually pay at that time, make sure the sales price is provided in the structured data.\r\n\r\nImportant: Some product spec attributes are not supported by schema.org.Specifying the following schema.org values is required for automatic item updates: price, priceCurrency, availability and condition. Learn more about supported structure data attributes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTest your markups\r\n\r\nTest your schema.org implementation with Search Console or the Rich Results Tool. Visit the Google Search Console Help Center to learn more about using the tool, debugging any issues, and interpreting your results in the tool.\r\n             Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7331077.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":93,"to":122}}}}],["1058345a-c99b-4f8d-ad1c-7dd2be5463f6",{"pageContent":"Best practices for advertising apparel and accessories\r\n\r\nCustomers are increasingly looking for ideas, finding the best products, and buying apparel and accessories on Google.

Providing the correct product data will help them make an informed decision.\r\n\r\nProvide high-quality images\r\n\r\nWhen customers shop online, they rely heavily on images to evaluate what you’re selling and decide what they want to buy. A photo can be the deciding factor for a user to click your ad or a free product listing. Make the right first impression with a high-quality image.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Use your highest resolution images. Be sure that you show the best image possible whether someone is seeing your ad or free listing on a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone. It's best to use a minimum image width of 1500 pixel. An ideal aspect ratio is 9:11 (width : height) for vertical images and 4:3 (width : height) for horizontal images. Also, make sure to remove any resizing UTM parameters (for example, http://thumbnail.google.com/imageurl.jpg?ex=400x400).","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7348545.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":29}}}}],["3e28b61c-bb55-40e2-802d-e145ce58e4e1",{"pageContent":"Show clothing on models. Showing how your product looks on a real person can help inspire customers to consider it for themselves. If you’re using a full-body image, avoid cropping the model’s head or feet.

Include attributes that aren't visible in the image, such as strong brand names, size, size type, or personalization options. Make sure you highlight what makes your product most relevant to your user while staying brief and clear.

Learn more about submitting the title [title] attribute.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If applicable, add size type. Showing the size type will help you find customers who are searching for a particular fit. For example, include “plus size”, “petite”, or “maternity” in your title [title] attribute.\r\n  If you offer personalization, let your customers know right away. Customization can be a key differentiator for your products. Add “customized”, “personalized”, or “monogrammed” to your title attribute.

To find out if the brand name is strong, see if customers commonly search for the brand name by using Google Trends.\r\n  Specify the gender or age group if it’s unclear in your product image. Include the gender (for example, women’s, men’s, girl’s, or boy’s) in your title [title] attribute. However, if your product is made for young children or babies, also add the age group [age_group] attribute to your product titles (for example, infant, toddler, newborn). It’s also helpful to your customers to specify the age group for unisex products (for example, adult, kids).","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7348545.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":78,"to":92}}}}],["b0dd3888-9ed4-4bc0-8674-62630bb34b0d",{"pageContent":"Include color, size, material, and/or pattern attributes.

Submitting the color name in your product title [title], description [description], and color [color] attributes will help match your products with the colors that people are looking for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe color name you submit in your product data should match the color name used on your product landing page. You can avoid product disapprovals and potentially confusing shoppers by not showing a different color name in your Shopping ad than the one you use on your product landing page. For example, if your product’s color is “ocean”, include “ocean” in your title [title], description [description], and color [color] attributes instead of changing the color name to “blue”.\r\n\r\nIf your product is multicolored (such as jewelry), submit up to 3 colors, separated by a “/”. For example, if your product is a gold necklace with turquoise stones, submit multiple color values as “gold/turquoise” in the color [color] attribute. Avoid using “multicolor”, “multi” or other similar values. Being more specific helps match your products with what your customers are searching for. Learn more about submitting the color [color] attribute.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuild out your product type\r\n\r\nCategorizing products in your product data provides a good structure for your Shopping campaigns to help manage and bid on your products effectively. Provide the most detailed product type [product_type] values you have (for example, Apparel & Accessories > Clothing > Outerwear > Coats & Jackets > Denim Jackets), and Google product category [google_product_category] values that are at least 2-3 levels deep.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Use Feed Rules to replace your product type attribute","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7348545.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":134,"to":158}}}}],["36c3507d-741e-4014-baad-115073e0da9a",{"pageContent":"Use Feed Rules to replace your product type attribute\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Note: Feed rules are currently only available in the classic version of Merchant Center.\r\n\r\n    You can replace your product type [product_type] attribute based on other values in your product data using Feed Rules. For example, if your product type [product_type] value is set to apparel, it may not be descriptive enough.

Learn more about setting up feed rules.\r\n\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProvide size type and size system\r\n\r\nWhen customers search for apparel and accessories, they won’t purchase a product if it isn't available in the right size and fit. Give a clear idea of your product’s sizing by using the size [size], size type [size_type], and size system [size_system] attributes.

If you don't provide these attributes, the system will use the default values.\r\n\r\nIf a specific garment comes in a specialty size, use the size type [size_type] attribute to help your product show for more relevant search results.

Learn more about submitting the size system [size_system] attribute.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubmit product variants as unique items grouped under an item group ID\r\n\r\nYou can manage product variants more easily by grouping them under the same item group ID [item_group_id].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you're selling a product in multiple variations, each color, size, material and pattern must be submitted as a unique product. Examples of product variants:\r\n\r\n\r\n  If a dress comes in 1 size and 5 colors, the product has 5 product variants.\r\n  If a pair of shoes comes in 3 sizes, 4 colors, and 2 materials, the product has 24 product variants.\r\n  If a bag comes in 2 sizes, 3 colors, and 2 patterns, the product has 12 product variants.\r\n\r\n\r\nDon't show all of your variant options as a single value within the corresponding attribute value. In the example below, you can check that the shirt comes in one size and three colors, but they're all under the same item group ID [item_group_id].\r\n\r\nExample\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Product data for a large, multi-colored broad stripe button-down shirt\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        ID [id]\r\n        Title\r\n        [title]\r\n        Item group ID\r\n        [item_group_id]\r\n        Size\r\n        [size]\r\n        Color\r\n        [color]\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        8842\r\n        Broad Stripe Button-Down Shirt - L\r\n        8842\r\n        L\r\n        Blue, green, and orange","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7348545.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":206,"to":272}}}}],["52896e0c-3bbf-4366-8772-ba0942fb2df9",{"pageContent":"[size]\r\n        Color\r\n        [color]\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        8842\r\n        Broad Stripe Button-Down Shirt - L\r\n        8842\r\n        L\r\n        Blue, green, and orange\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nInstead, each product variant should be submitted as a unique item in the feed.

In addition, a differentiated title [title] helps you showcase the details and attributes of each product so customers quickly find what they’re looking for.\r\n  \r\n    Provide a value for the GTIN [gtin] attributes whenever available for your products. GTINs help us understand exactly what product you're showing. When we understand what you're selling or listing, we can help boost your performance by adding valuable details about the product and serving your Shopping ads and free listings in more relevant ways. This also means that your ads and free listings can appear in more places on Google, YouTube, and our partner sites.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Tip\r\n\r\n    Retailers who've added correct GTINs to their product data have seen a 20% increase in clicks on average.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMatch your product data to your landing pages\r\n\r\nFollow landing page requirements to make sure your customers’ expectations are met.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Use the same product title and description that you do on your landing page. Don’t use synonyms or search query terms that aren’t included in your product’s landing page. Customers expect the messaging of your product ads and listings to match your landing pages. Differences can create a poor shopping experience or cause customers to leave your page without buying anything.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7380908.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":56,"to":77}}}}],["e1e12a3c-e540-4046-b198-eee79ee9d6c3",{"pageContent":"Use product landing pages that show the same product variant that you use in your Shopping ad or listing.

Tax for Shopping ads and free listings is restricted to two concepts: value-added tax (generally called VAT, IVA, TVA, MWST, or GST in different countries) and sales tax. Most countries use VAT, while the US has a sales tax system. Keep in mind that each country’s tax regulations and policies differ. When you set up specific tax and shipping settings for a new country, ensure that you provide correct information for your products. Learn more about tax settings\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Included tax vs. excluded tax using currency of the target country\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Tax inclusion policies and audience needs can differ across countries. If you list your products in a country with tax inclusion policies that are different from those in your target country, you may need to adjust your tax practices. Since you're using the currency of the target country, you need to follow the price and tax requirements of the target country.\r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          Example\r\n\r\n          In Germany, tax is included in product prices. In Canada, tax isn’t included. A merchant based in Germany that exports to Canada in the currency of the target country must not include any tax in their product prices. In Canada, merchants must also not submit any tax in the tax [tax] attribute. If the merchant does charge tax in Canada, they can say so on their landing or checkout pages.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Included tax vs. excluded tax using currency conversion\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      If you use currency conversion, consumers can assume that you're not a local advertiser. As such, you have to follow the price and tax requirements for the country that matches your chosen currency.\r\n\r\n      \r\n        \r\n          Example","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7387995.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":404,"to":437}}}}],["35506ca1-70f9-4051-8f5d-f60010c327d6",{"pageContent":"Example\r\n\r\n          If a merchant exports to Australia in USD, Australian customers are able to identify the merchant’s location by the currency in the ad. The merchant must follow US sales tax rules in their product data and on their website. The tax [tax] attribute should be used in place of the price [price] attribute to submit tax information. Since Australian consumers expect taxes to be included in prices, ads show a “+tax” annotation to indicate to users that tax isn't included in the price.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Different levels of included tax\r\n\r\n  \r\n    If you sell from one country that includes tax in prices into another country, it’s likely that the VAT rates are different. You must include tax in your product prices. If you use the currency of the target country, you can choose to include the tax rate you use on your website. If you use currency conversion, you should use the VAT rate from the country of your chosen currency.\r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          Example\r\n\r\n          If a French retailer (VAT rate 20%) exports to Sweden (VAT rate 25%), they can choose to include either 20% or 25% in the product price as long as it matches both the landing page and the checkout pages on their website.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Identify import or export charges. These are charges that cover costs charged in direct connection with products crossing a border. Often this is referred to as duty, excise, or customs, but can also include storage cost, special handling fees, or other costs. Some countries also charge a luxury tax or product specific tax for certain imports. These types of charges don’t fall under the tax category, but are considered an import or export charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make sure that consumers can connect information they see on Google with the information that they see on your website, you must clearly label the relevant costs and submit information in your product data accordingly.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7387995.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":437,"to":468}}}}],["3b5ef755-4687-4d7a-a4bd-64d1da86e579",{"pageContent":"Based on how you operate, you may display import and export charges on your checkout page separately, combine them into a single line item, or combine some of them with existing shipping costs. The import or export charges can be combined into the shipping [shipping] or price [price] attribute. If they are combined with the price [price] attribute, the product price on the landing page and checkout page must match the value submitted for the price [price] attribute, and the item can only be listed in the target country.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Example\r\n\r\n    Your shipping provider handles customs clearance, but you still charge import duties yourself. On your checkout page, you should have a “shipping and customs” charge and an “import duty” charge. You should submit a shipping cost that includes customs clearance charges and matches the “shipping and customs” charge on your checkout page. The import duty charge needs to be displayed on the checkout page, but doesn’t need to be submitted to Google.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements for your export country\r\n\r\n\r\n  Make sure your landing pages are up to date.

Taking this extra step will ensure that your product can be listed on the actual launch date. You can add your new product data:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Before the launch date (recommended) so your product data and campaign setup can ramp up leading to the actual launch announcement. Set the value for the availability [availability] attribute to preorder, and set the value for the availability date [availability_date] attribute to the official release date of the product.

This way, when someone clicks through from your ad, they will see the same product variant they were searching for.\r\n\r\nOne way of preselecting product variants is by appending unique URL parameters to your link [link] attribute. Always test to make sure your landing page passes the URL parameter back properly and behaves as expected. For example, your landing page should load a preselected radio button or drop-down selection of the respective phone variant.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you can allow Google to pull in product information for multiple variants on the same landing page by adding structured data markup to your landing page’s source code.

For example, if your products are categorized using product_type value Apparel & Accessories > Clothing > Uniforms > White Coats, you can assign product type [product_type] to a custom attribute, and use Split & choose to keep only \"White coats\". Then, you can use this value to append or prepend to other attributes in your feed, such as the title [title] attribute.\r\n\r\n  Split: Signify at which type of node or symbol you'd like to separate your list. For example, \">\" \",\" or \";\".\r\n\r\n  Select: Select which of the elements, or nodes, you'd like to use. You can choose values like \"first\" or \"last\", or you can select a range of values, such as \"1-second last\" or \"2-5\".\r\n\r\n  Combine: If you have selected multiple nodes, use Combine to join them together in a single value, using a separator of your choice.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Note: You may use Split in combination with Select and/or Combine. If you don't Combine the value you split, you may create a repeated attribute. For example: a > b > c is split on \">\" then you select 2-3. If you combine on \"+\" you will get one single value 'b + c'. If you don't combine the values, you'll end up with a repeated attribute - with the two values 'b' and 'c'.\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Example:\r\n\r\n      Create a custom attribute by splitting and selecting the last node of the product type [product_type] string Apparel & Accessories > Clothing > Uniforms > White Coats in order to append it to the title [title] attribute.\r\n\r\n      \r\n        Create a custom attribute with the name \"last node product type\"\r\n        Set the custom attribute to \"my_first_feed.product_type\"\r\n        Split: Split on \">\".

Product reviews are used to calculate product ratings for the products that you sell on your site and have no effect on the seller rating calculation.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  I implemented the new code for collecting product reviews. When will product ratings start surfacing with my ads?\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Product ratings will begin surfacing on your Shopping ads as well as the Shopping tab when Google has successfully collected product reviews on your behalf. The process toward eligibility begins with Google receiving valid GTINs via the opt-in module for orders placed on your site.\r\n\r\n      Please note that product ratings will only surface for any given product when Google has 3 reviews or more for that product. If a specific product you have provided a GTIN for does not have product ratings surfacing, this may be because Google has not yet received sufficient reviews for that product.

Google Shopping bids on behalf of merchants it represents in the same way acting like any other CSS.\r\n\r\nThis means that as a merchant, you can choose to participate in Shopping ads on the Google general search results page in various ways: you can provide your product data to any CSS, including Google Shopping, and you can also use multiple CSSs at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCSSs use a separate Merchant Center account for each merchant they represent. Each account allows them to upload inventory for a merchant and run Performance Max Campaigns and Shopping Campaigns on their behalf. You can also add products through the Product Editor in your Business Profiles. Learn more about submitting products through Business Profiles\r\n\r\nAll campaigns need to follow the same Shopping ads policies and product data requirements. This means, for example, that Shopping ads need to take users directly to a merchant's landing page where they can buy the advertised product.\r\n\r\nShopping ads on Google general search results pages where the CSS program is available will also show which CSS uploaded the offer (the “By CSS” link displayed at the bottom of the ad). If users click on that link, they are taken to the CSS’s own website.\r\n\r\nFrequently asked questions","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7558973.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":27}}}}],["699187f9-8c13-4400-a42c-3e00401ce6ed",{"pageContent":"Frequently asked questions\r\n\r\nDo I need to use a CSS to place Shopping ads on the Google general search results page?\r\n\r\nYes, only CSSs can place Shopping ads. You can use Google Shopping or any other CSS of your choice. You can also participate via several CSSs at the same time.\r\n\r\nDo I have to pay Google for ads placed by CSSs on my behalf?\r\n\r\nNo. CSSs (including Google Shopping) pay Google for clicks on the ads they place. CSSs can choose how to invoice their merchants. For example, Google Shopping generally charges its merchants based on a CPC model.\r\n\r\nNote that clicks on the “By CSS” link at the bottom of the ads (which lead to the website of the CSS) are currently free for CSSs.\r\n\r\nWill my products be shown several times next to one another?\r\n\r\nWe do our best not to show multiple instances of the same offer (that's the same product offered by the same merchant). If we identify that the same product from the same merchant has been uploaded by several CSSs, we will only show it once in the ad unit. In the rare cases when we cannot detect that two offers are the same, they may both show up in the same Shopping unit. The CPCs paid by the winning CSSs do not increase in such a scenario because a merchant is never second-priced against itself (see next question). \r\n\r\nDifferent products from the same merchant can appear via several CSSs in the same unit. For example, if a user searches for running shoes, one model of running shoe you sell may appear in an ad from CSS A while another model appears in an ad from CSS B. The CPCs paid by the winning CSSs also do not increase in such a scenario because a merchant is never second-priced against itself (see next question).\r\n\r\nWill I end up paying more for Shopping ads if more than one CSS advertises on my behalf?","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7558973.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":27,"to":45}}}}],["67c13d85-ec83-4588-a723-e81567d1a452",{"pageContent":"Will I end up paying more for Shopping ads if more than one CSS advertises on my behalf?\r\n\r\nA merchant will never be second-priced against itself in the auction for any offer, and that rule holds irrespective of the number, or identity, of the CSSs used by the merchant. Therefore, if two CSSs place bids on behalf of the same merchant, the winning offer and the price paid by the winning CSS will be the same as if those bids had been placed by one and the same CSS.\r\n\r\nThe fact that several CSSs place ads on your behalf won’t mean your offers are being repeated or that Google will charge more for a click on any of them.\r\n\r\nExamples: CSS A bids 30 cents per click to place your offer. For simplicity, we assume all ads have the same quality and relevance.\r\n\r\nScenario 1: The next highest CSS bid is 20 cents on behalf of a different merchant. Your offer will win the auction at a cost of 20 cents – only as much as necessary to maintain the position.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Offers uploaded through\r\n        Merchant\r\n        Bid placed by CSS\r\n        Price paid by winning CSS if their ad is clicked\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        CSS A\r\n        Merchant 1 (you)\r\n        30\r\n        20\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        CSS A\r\n        Merchant 2\r\n        20\r\n        --\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        CSS A\r\n        Merchant 3\r\n        15\r\n        --\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        CSS A\r\n        Merchant 4\r\n        12\r\n        --\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nScenario 2: Now assume another CSS starts advertising on your behalf and bids 25 cents. You still win the auction with the 30 cent bid that CSS A made on your behalf, but the next closest competitor now bids 25 cents. Since this competitor is a CSS who’s also bidding on your behalf, we do not use that second bid to determine the price that CSS A pays. Instead we find the next highest bid that’s been placed for a different merchant, which is still 20 cents.

Depending on their pricing scheme, they may also report additional information or share detailed bidding data. Google Shopping also reports the number of clicks sent to a merchant and the cost charged per click, together with other metrics. Google Shopping is required by the European Commission to be independently profitable in EEA countries where Shopping ads are available. Google Shopping currently ensures profitability by deducting a fixed percentage margin from each merchant bid before entering it into the auction. The margin is included in the CPC paid by the merchant and is charged only when a user clicks on one of the merchant's ads. In general, we recommend that merchants compare cost and returns of different marketing channels to assess which ones work best for them.\r\n\r\nWhere will my product ads be shown?\r\n\r\nShopping ads placed by CSSs (including Google Shopping) show on Google general search results pages. To avoid user confusion, they also have to be shown on the website of the CSS that submitted them (in the case of Google Shopping the site at google.com/shopping).\r\n\r\nHow can I find out which CSSs advertise on my behalf on Shopping ads?\r\n\r\nSign in to your Merchant Center account. Click the tools icon , then choose Shopping ads setup under “Tools.” You will find a dashboard showing you all CSSs that have uploaded products from your website. You can also find contact information for each of them. If you don't have a Merchant Center account for the domain in question, you can create one for free. You don't need to upload any offers to see the dashboard.\r\n\r\nIs it better to advertise through a specific CSS?","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7558973.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":170,"to":195}}}}],["d078b307-3d5c-4c32-abd0-b7f3af54e1b5",{"pageContent":"Is it better to advertise through a specific CSS?\r\n\r\nWhat works best for you depends on your business, your goals, and the services offered by CSSs.

No ad space is reserved for any particular CSS.\r\n\r\nWhat if I don't want a specific CSS to advertise for my products?\r\n\r\nDifferent CSSs may provide different value-add services. However, we understand that you may want to control how your ads are appearing. We recommend that you reach out to the relevant CSS to discuss any concerns you might have (customer service website, phone number, and email address are provided for each CSS in your Merchant Center dashboard). All CSSs can adjust the volume of traffic that they are sending you using bids and budgets as well as pausing or activating campaigns. Some CSSs allow their merchants to control campaigns directly through an interface they provide. You can also use the dashboard in Merchant Center to opt in and out of a particular CSS channel.

For general information on returns, see the Merchant Center guidelines.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nThere are three pieces of your returns configuration for Buy on Google:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Return policies (mandatory)\r\n  Return addresses (mandatory)\r\n  Return rules (recommended)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, you'll need to follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Requirements for processing returns\r\n  Additional returns policies\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: The configurable settings will guide your return settings, but will not ensure that your return settings adhere to the required policies. Products that don't meet the minimum standards may be removed from your available inventory. Changes to return settings can take up to a day to reflect on your products.\r\n\r\n\r\nReturn policies\r\n\r\nA minimum of one return policy is required for all the products you sell on Buy on Google. Return policies can be added via the \"Returns\" section in Merchant Center, via feeds, or via the Content API.\r\n\r\nThe first return policy you create will be your default return policy. Additional return policies can be created by using labels to define groups of products, like electronics or apparel, and then applying specific return policies to those groups. These policies can be specified in the feed with the return policy label [return_policy_label].\r\n\r\nIf the feed for a product does not include a return policy label [return_policy_label]column, or if the return policy label [return_policy_label] attribute is blank, or if the return policy specified by the feed cannot be found, the default return policy will be used.\r\n\r\nRequirements for return policies","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7660807.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":41}}}}],["23977d53-e728-48a0-8c26-a9b4ec259b77",{"pageContent":"Requirements for return policies\r\n\r\nThe following are requirements your return policies must meet.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Return window\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      You choose whether or not products with a specific return policy can be returned, and if so, for how long. Eligibility for return is calculated from the date when the product was delivered (or the latest estimated delivery date if the actual delivery date is not available).\r\n\r\n      Your default return policy must allow customers to make returns for up to at least 30 days, from the delivery date. Additional return policies shorter than 30 days may be created, but should only be applied to products in allowable exception categories.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Exceptions: You may provide a return policy with a minimum of 14 days for electronic products. You may provide a return policy that designates food products, perishables, or living things as ineligible for return.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Customer return fee\r\n\r\n  \r\n    By default, all returns on Buy on Google are marked as free returns. However, you may select some or all of the customer remorse reasons (\"better price found\", \"changed mind\", \"does not fit\", \"no longer needed\", and \"ordered wrong product\") for a return to indicate when the cost of return shipping is the responsibility of the customer. If you don't select a reason, or if the reason for return is not included among the reasons you're able to select, you'll be responsible for the cost of the return and the customer will be informed that there are “Free returns” for the purchase. You'll also be required to specify the actual cost of return shipping that the customers will be charged. Restocking fees are not allowed and therefore cannot be specified.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Seasonal overrides","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7660807.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":41,"to":72}}}}],["8a8784a6-01b5-4552-bfc9-acb04ba8427b",{"pageContent":"Seasonal overrides\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      In order to accommodate high volumes of both orders and returns during periods such as holidays, you can create seasonal overrides during which there are exceptions to your standard return policy. For example, you might set a seasonal override for products ordered between November 1 and December 25 that allows those products to be returned until January 31 of the following year.\r\n\r\n      If you set a specific date until which products may be returned and that date differs from the return window of a non-seasonal policy, the more favorable of the two policies will be applied.

You can mark your offers as requiring either \"special processing return\" or \"returnless refund\".\r\n\r\nThe steps to create a return rule depend on which experience you're using: the new or previous way to configure return rules.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the new way to configure return rules, you'll need to configure return rule settings in your Merchant Center account by specifying price conditions.\r\n\r\nIf you're using the previous way to configure return rules, you'll need to configure its settings in your Merchant Center account and then add it to a product by using the return rule label [return_rule_label] attribute in your feeds or via Content API.

If the feed for a product does not include a return policy label column, if the return policy label [return_policy_label] attribute is blank, or if the return policy specified by the feed cannot be found, the default return policy will be used.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\7660817.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":28}}}}],["325c2bcb-2a2a-4905-b3d0-0c936adba26c",{"pageContent":"Additional return policies can be created by using labels to define groups of products, like electronics or apparel, and then applying specific return policies to those groups. These policies can be specified in the feed with the return policy label [return_policy_label].\r\n\r\nRequirements for return policies\r\n\r\n\r\n  Return window\r\n\r\n  \r\n    You choose whether or not products with a specific return policy can be returned, and if so, for how long. Eligibility for return is calculated from the date when the products were delivered (or the latest estimated delivery date if the actual delivery date is not available).\r\n\r\n    Exceptions: You may provide a return policy with a minimum of 14 days for electronics products. You may also provide a return policy that designates food products, perishables, or living things as ineligible for return.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Customer return fees\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Select reasons for return fees (such as, “does not fit” or “ordered by mistake”) to indicate the reason for the return is the responsibility of the customer.

Results may vary based on the carrier used. To mark an item as delivered, the order must first have \"Shipped\" status. Once an order has been marked as shipped, a \"Mark as delivered\" button will appear in the \"Shipments\" section on the \"Order details\" page.\r\n\r\nTo mark a product as delivered, click \"Mark as delivered\".

This will release the hold of funds from the customer’s payment method, and an automated email will be sent by Google informing the customer of the cancellation. You can also cancel a specific line item if a customer wishes to remove a specific item from their order.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9039381.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":208,"to":229}}}}],["72ae92c0-98f7-41fb-be07-9a4ee350ab60",{"pageContent":"To report a canceled order, click the 3-dot icon  from the \"Order details\" page then select \"Cancel order\".

CSSs offer different areas of expertise, services, and charging models. Some specialize in specific categories (apparel, for example). Some manage feeds and campaigns for you, while others provide tools for you to manage your product data and bidding strategies yourself. Hybrid models exist as well, and CSSs may offer a variety of additional services. Some CSSs charge a fee per click, while with others you might pay a commission when a click on an ad leads to a sale. Combining the strengths of several CSSs can increase the overall performance of your Shopping ads.\r\n\r\nYou need to work with at least one CSS to place Shopping ads or free listings. You can work with several at the same time if you prefer. This article provides an overview of some of the different setups that we've seen CSSs offer.\r\n\r\nWorking with a CSS\r\n\r\nThere are a number of different ways in which CSS and merchants can agree to work together. Any given CSS might offer multiple service models or tailor services to your specific needs.\r\n\r\nManaged service","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9133811.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":25}}}}],["d6114333-0180-4595-b8ca-6261351f95ab",{"pageContent":"Managed service\r\n\r\nIn this case, the CSS creates a Merchant Center and a Google Ads account on your behalf. You provide your product data to the CSS and they optimize your feed, upload it to Google, and manage your campaigns. Some CSSs may also use your product data to generate leads for you from other channels.\r\n\r\nGoogle will invoice the CSS for clicks on the ads they place on your behalf. The cost that Google charges the CSS will depend on the outcome of the ad auction. The CSS in turn will charge you. The pricing model will depend on the agreement you have with that CSS. For example, some CSSs may charge a fixed price per click, some a different click price by category, and some a commission only when a click leads to a sale.\r\n\r\nThe CSS typically provides you with reporting of the performance of their activities and the associated cost, potentially across the different channels they use. In this model, you won't normally have access to the Merchant Center and Google Ads accounts that the CSS runs on your behalf, but you may have access to tools the CSS provides.\r\n\r\nSelf-service\r\n\r\nIn this case, the CSS creates a Merchant Center and a Google Ads account on your behalf and then gives you access to these accounts. Another alternative is to switch your existing account from one CSS to another. You manage your feeds and campaigns yourself.\r\n\r\nGoogle will invoice the CSS for clicks on the ads they place on your behalf. The cost that Google charges the CSS will depend on the outcome of the ad auction. The CSS in turn will charge you. The pricing model will depend on the agreement you have with that CSS. In this model, the CSS typically charges a fixed-percentage markup on the CPC paid in the Google auction. Other pricing schemes exist. Some CSSs enable merchants to directly pay their Google Ads invoice and charge separately for the CSS’s services.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9133811.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":25,"to":37}}}}],["dd4d6478-502e-4c01-b1eb-9afe05adbccf",{"pageContent":"You typically have direct access to reporting in Merchant Center and Google Ads. The CSS may provide additional reporting on the performance of the campaigns and the associated cost. Some CSSs may provide consulting services to assist you with your Shopping ads activity.\r\n\r\nHybrid models\r\n\r\nThese models combine aspects of managed service and self-service models. For example, a CSS may manage and optimize your product data feed, but you run the campaigns yourself. Or the other way around, you manage your feed yourself, while the CSS runs the campaigns for you.\r\n\r\nVariants of these hybrid setups involve the CSS creating a new Merchant Center account on your behalf, which you then link to an existing Google Ads account. This way you can use your existing Google Ads account to manage Shopping ads placed through the CSS.\r\n\r\nOther variants involve Google invoicing you directly for ads by a CSS. This may be a more suitable setup if you manage your Shopping campaigns yourself. In these cases, the CSS typically invoices you separately for their services.\r\n\r\nSome CSSs might offer additional services beyond those described above.\r\n\r\nUsing conversion reporting and auto-bidding\r\n\r\nWhatever model they offer you, all CSSs have access to the same features, including conversion reporting and Google’s auto-bidding tools.\r\n\r\nIf you’d like to use conversion reporting and auto-bidding with a CSS, there are several ways, including:\r\n\r\nAdd a Google Ads conversion tracking tag to your website\r\n\r\nYou add a Google Ads conversion tracking tag, or code snippet, to your website for the CSS you’d like to work with. Based on this conversion data, the CSS can then run auto-bidding campaigns on your behalf.\r\n\r\nLearn more about adding conversion tracking to your website\r\n\r\nShare conversions via a Google Ads manager account","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9133811.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":39,"to":63}}}}],["e63f57dd-5972-4a91-bcbb-d5b084427e8c",{"pageContent":"Learn more about adding conversion tracking to your website\r\n\r\nShare conversions via a Google Ads manager account\r\n\r\nIf you've already set up conversion tracking with one CSS, you can share this conversion data with another CSS. To do this, the new CSS links the Google Ads account used for your new campaigns to your Google Ads manager account (if you don’t have one, you can create one). The new CSS can then run auto-bidding campaigns based on this shared conversion data.\r\n\r\nLearn more about cross-account conversion tracking\r\n\r\nShare conversions via Google Analytics\r\n\r\nIf you're importing conversion data in your Google Ads account using Google Analytics, you can also use this method with CSSs by linking the Google Ads account used for your campaigns to your Google Analytics.\r\n\r\nUsing third-party bidding tools\r\n\r\nAny third-party bidding tools compatible with Google Ads and Shopping campaigns can also be used by CSSs. In a managed service model, the CSS uses the third-party tool to manage bids on your behalf. In a self-service model, you use the third-party tool yourself to place bids through the CSS.\r\n\r\nPlacing products beyond general search\r\n\r\nBy default, a CSS can place products only in the Shopping unit on Google’s general search results pages in CSS program countries.\r\n\r\nSome CSSs opt in to placing products also on the Display network and on other surfaces beyond Google’s general search results pages (such as the Shopping tab, YouTube, and more) in CSS program countries. If you work with one of these CSSs, they can place products on your behalf on Google’s general search results pages and these other surfaces, for any feature available on those surfaces.\r\n\r\nUsing free product listings in Europe\r\n\r\nIf you’d like to place products in free listings, you can do so through any CSS in Europe. You can select only one CSS to use for free listings in Europe in your CSS dashboard.\r\n\r\nPlacing products outside of Europe","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9133811.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":63,"to":89}}}}],["b7e60dc8-4f8c-4ddd-b736-f439fc7bcfd7",{"pageContent":"Placing products outside of Europe\r\n\r\nYou can choose only one CSS to place products for you in Shopping ads and free listings outside of Europe. You can change this selection in your CSS dashboard.\r\n\r\nFinding a CSS\r\n\r\nYou can find eligible CSS partners on Google’s Comparison Shopping Partners portal. Filter by one or more countries, industries, or supported languages to find CSSs that fit your specific needs. You can also set filters to search for partners that offer API feed technology or for premium partners that have additional technical certification and offer conversion tracking for merchants.\r\n\r\nSwitching an account from one CSS to another\r\n\r\nIf you’d like to keep an existing Merchant Center account, but work with a different CSS, you can request to have your account switched from one CSS to another. Ask your new CSS to initiate the switch. After the CSS has initiated the switch, it can be approved or declined by a Merchant Center account admin. Note that a Merchant Center account can be associated with only one CSS at a time.\r\n\r\nGoogle Ads accounts don’t need to be switched.

Customers should be able to add in stock products to their cart and finalize their purchase.\r\n  Tell customers about minimum order values. If you require that a minimum value is met before a purchase is completed or shipped, set that value in your shipping settings.

As always, you are responsible for ensuring that your promotions comply with all applicable laws and regulations.\r\n\r\nThe approval process requires 2 steps:","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9171235.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":37}}}}],["8a718c36-532c-4815-816a-9bed93944784",{"pageContent":"The approval process requires 2 steps:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Policy review: The policy review confirms the promotion follows all editorial requirements and program policies and will occur shortly after a promotion is submitted during weekday business hours.\r\n  Validation review: When a promotion becomes active on your site, Google testers will verify that the promotion works and that it follows all program policies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf your promotion doesn’t comply with the policies for one of your selected destinations, your promotion will be disapproved for that destination only. It may still appear on other destinations.\r\n\r\nCreate a promotion\r\n\r\nYou can create a promotion two different ways - through a promotion feed or using the promotion builder in the \"Promotions\" section of your Merchant Center account. Below, you’ll find a detailed review of each method.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Make sure you’ve completed the Help request to the promotions form. Our team will let you know when you’re ready to start implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubmit a promotions feed\r\n\r\nThe promotions feed is a spreadsheet that contains all of the promotions you use online. Use a promotions feed if you have a high volume of promotions to submit.\r\n\r\nTo submit a promotions feed:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sign in to your Merchant Center account.\r\n  Create a spreadsheet (for example: tab-delimited file, .xml file, or Google Sheets).\r\n  Use the required feed attributes to tell us about each of your promotions. Learn more about promotions on Buy on Google feed specification\r\n  To upload your promotions feed, click Marketing on the navigation menu, then click Promotions.\r\n  Click the Promotion feeds link in the top-right corner of the page.\r\n\r\n\r\nPromotion builder\r\n\r\nThe promotion builder is located in the \"Promotions\" section of your Merchant Center account. It allows you to manually enter individual promotions. Use the promotion builder if you have a small number of promotions to submit.\r\n\r\nTo add promotions manually, follow the steps below:","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9171235.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":37,"to":72}}}}],["412dd6f9-4030-4402-9e71-7dcab89b0113",{"pageContent":"To add promotions manually, follow the steps below:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Click Marketing in the navigation menu, then click Promotions.\r\n  Click the plus icon .\r\n  Enter the promotion details and click Save.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe promotion will appear in your dashboard.

Input limit is 1000 values.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThis option is available for both the promotion builder and the promotions feed.\r\n\r\nExample: Say you are selling shoes, and you want to run a promotion on all shoes except for a select few. You can use the Item ID filter to exclude SKUs you aren't promoting.\r\n\r\n\r\n  We recommend submitting promotions at least 24 hours prior to their effective start date. Occasionally, promotions submitted less than 24 hours before the effective start date may experience approval and display delays.\r\n\r\n\r\nDestination\r\n\r\nThe Destination attribute allows you to target your promotions to Shopping Ads, Buy on Google, Free listings or any combination of these. Based on how you submit your promotion, there are a few ways to add the destination.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Some of the names for product destinations have been updated. You may have previously submitted the following values as destinations for your products: Shopping Actions, Surfaces across Google, Local surfaces across Google. These values will still be accepted, but we recommend that you update your products to include the new values for these destinations: Buy_on_Google_listings, Free_listings, Free_local_listings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPromotion builder","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9171235.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":72,"to":106}}}}],["91920d56-6232-442c-b8fb-68ab4070e39c",{"pageContent":"Promotion builder\r\n\r\nAfter you begin building a promotion with the promotion builder, you will see a Destinations section.

The product was disapproved because it didn't meet our image requirements.\r\n  After turning on automatic image improvements, the promotional overlay was removed, and the product was approved again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Original image\r\n      Improved image","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9242973.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":49}}}}],["f9632591-d2be-4601-869d-ac9155d17d6a",{"pageContent":"Original image\r\n      Improved image\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee which images were improved\r\n\r\nYou can see which images have had promotional overlays removed by checking the warnings in Diagnostics in your Merchant Center account. Look for the title Improved image quality [image_link] in the “Issue” column of the table. On the product detail pages of affected products, you can see the improved image as well as the originally uploaded image.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to address issues\r\n\r\nIf you don’t like the improved version of an image, you can replace it by uploading a new image. Make sure to change the image URL that you provide in your feed so that Google can immediately crawl the new image. If you reupload the original image that caused the product disapproval, the product will be disapproved again.\r\n\r\n\r\nManage automatic image improvements\r\n\r\nAutomatic image improvements are turned off by default. You can turn them on and manage your settings at any time.\r\n\r\nTo manage the settings for automatic image improvements:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sign in to your Merchant Center account.\r\n  Click the tools icon , then select Automatic improvements under “Settings.”\r\n  On the following page, click the Image improvements tab and adjust your settings for automatic image improvements.\r\n\r\n             Was this helpful?How can we improve it?YesNoSubmit","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9242973.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":49,"to":81}}}}],["7a4d4bca-8005-439c-b07f-18107e885afa",{"pageContent":"About settlement reports\r\n  Buy on Google for Search and Shopping will no longer be available starting September 26, 2023.

Product data alerts allow Google to notify you by email as soon as a problem with your eligible products is detected.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nBy default, an alert will be triggered if a significant drop in active products is detected for any combination of target country and Google surface (for example, US + Shopping ads). The email will explain what happened and provide you with links to the relevant section of Merchant Center so that you can instantly check on your product data.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Any significant drops will cause an alert, even if they might've been intentional. A change in item status from \"active\" to \"expiring\" may also cause an alert. This status change occurs 3 days before an item expires.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther types of product data alerts, such as product protection, are opt-in only and must be turned on before you can begin receiving notifications.\r\n\r\nYou can opt in or out of these alerts by changing your email preferences. Learn how to Change your Merchant Center email preferences.\r\n\r\nAvailability\r\n\r\nProduct data alerts are available for the following destinations, regardless of feed type:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Shopping ads\r\n  Local inventory ads\r\n  Buy on Google\r\n  Display ads\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Multi-client accounts may opt in to product data alerts at the top-level account.

Learn more about promotions\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nMapping items in the order to the discounts\r\n\r\nCurrently, we do not match order line items to the item level discount applied as a result of a promotion. To calculate the correct refund amount, manually map the item to the discount and deduct the promotion value from item net amount. Each line item also has promotion information for each individual product. If you need to calculate the refund, you can do so by deducting the discount for the individual product from the original product price. The necessary information is also available through the Orders API by searching for “promotions.”\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note on invoices: If you are generating invoices for customers, the discounted item prices paid by the customer can be calculated using the same methods for calculating refund amounts as outlined in this article.\r\n\r\n\r\nExample:\r\n\r\nA customer purchases three condiments in bulk for $4.99 each with a promotion of 10% off the gross total, but the customer wants to return one of the items. The merchant will need to calculate the refund amount and include the deduction in the return price. If 10% was deducted from $4.99, then the merchant will need to deduct 49 cents from the return price resulting in a refunded price of $4.50. Learn more about supported promotion types\r\n\r\nHow to process an item level refund for a Quantity Discount\r\n\r\nIf the total discount depends on the quantity of products sold in one purchase, and a customer initiates a return for a few items in the order, to initiate a refund accordingly, you should distribute the discount equally on all the items within the order.\r\n\r\nExample:","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9362273.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":23}}}}],["bdbc3e1e-c4f1-4b41-bf29-2ad150cd72e5",{"pageContent":"Example:\r\n\r\nIf a customer purchases three tee shirts for $30 each and gets $10 off your order, you would divide $80 (the total paid by the customer for the 3 tee shirts) by 3 and refund $26.66 for a single tee shirt.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Need help?

Once your Merchant Center account is linked to your payment service provider, you’ll be able to check your payment service provider log for bank disbursements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Linking to a payment service provider enables backend payment processing and transaction support, and doesn’t impact customers’ buying options. Payment service providers may charge you a fee for payment processing. These fees will be negotiated between you and the payment service provider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In some states, Google is responsible for collecting and remitting taxes to state tax authorities. In states where marketplace facilitator tax applies, Google collects sales tax.\r\n\r\n  Details on form 1099 should be obtained directly from the selected PSP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: For the state of Colorado, don’t include any retail delivery fee in your product feed. Therefore, a retail delivery fee shouldn’t be included in shipping [shipping], price [price], tax [tax], or any other attribute. Learn more about Colorado retail delivery fee.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisbursements\r\n\r\nThere is no need to link your bank account to your Merchant Center account, as all bank disbursements will come directly from the payment service provider into the account you have set up with them. You can continue using Merchant Center for order management, returns, and to access a settlement report for transaction-level details, which will also align with your payment service provider account.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9401147.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":32}}}}],["9b1bee0c-6078-4189-90c8-cd684e53c663",{"pageContent":"Returns and refund updates are to be coordinated through Google.

Note that the item’s local store availability must be clearly visible on only your product landing page.\r\n    Alternatively, store selection for pickup can occur in your checkout flow after a customer has added an item to their cart.\r\n      \r\n        The item's pickup availability can be displayed after clicking on a link (for example, “check local availability”) or after submitting a postal code or address.\r\n        After a customer clicks or inputs the required information, your site must display an item’s store pickup availability and the location of the local store.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9432086.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":27}}}}],["00ceab46-0f8c-4879-a96f-be99e51d3432",{"pageContent":"After a customer clicks or inputs the required information, your site must display an item’s store pickup availability and the location of the local store.\r\n          \r\n            An item’s displayed store pickup availability must match the pickup SLA provided in your feed.\r\n            The pickup availability must be shown before customers are required to enter their payment method.\r\n              \r\n                Important: Pickup availability can be different from store local availability.

They’ll do this by sending you a request to link your account to theirs.

There are several different notifications you may receive.\r\n\r\nNew order notifications\r\n\r\nPending order notifications\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pending order notifications will let you know when an order is ready for shipment. This may include a single product, or multiple products. The message will include the order date, and the Google order ID. You’ll find direct links to the orders page in the Merchant Center. You can update your order statuses from there.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Note: All orders will also appear in your Merchant Center account as soon as they’re placed with the status “Pending\".\r\n  \r\n\r\n  Making sure your orders are up to date and providing accurate and timely tracking information is essential for your performance score on Buy on Google. Learn more about retailer standards and policies\r\n\r\n\r\nLate shipment notifications\r\n\r\n\r\n  Late shipment notification emails let you know orders that are still pending at their ship by date. Google expects the order to be shipped by the specified ship by date and will cancel the order if it is pending for 5 days past that. Reminders like this one will prompt you to act on the order early to avoid the cancellation, and will lead to a better customer experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nCancellation and refund notifications\r\n\r\nOrder pending automatic cancellation notifications","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9440567.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":38}}}}],["9f52dd8f-2365-4499-a2ce-ee098ff8d10b",{"pageContent":"Cancellation and refund notifications\r\n\r\nOrder pending automatic cancellation notifications\r\n\r\n\r\n  Order pending automatic cancellation notification emails lets you know of orders that are still pending after the ship-by-date, and will be cancelled in 48 hours. This email may be helpful because it tells you why your order was cancelled by Google, and how to prevent such cancellations in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder automatically cancelled notifications\r\n\r\n\r\n  Order automatic cancelled notification emails lets you know of orders that have been cancelled because they were not shipped within 5 days of their ship by date. This email is helpful because it tells you why their order was cancelled by google and how to prevent such cancellations in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrder cancellation request notifications\r\n\r\nOrder cancellation notifications will let you know when Google wants you to cancel an order. The notification will be sent via email and merchant center. From there, you'll find details and links explaining why Google wants you to cancel the order (for example, when a user account is fraudulent) and the next steps you should take.\r\n\r\nCustomer service-issued refund notifications\r\n\r\n\r\n  Customer service-issued refund notifications will let you know when Google Customer Service has refunded an order or product without a return shipment. This will allow you to open a dispute with the carrier if necessary. These refunds may be issued for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    WRONG_ITEM: Incorrect item sent\r\n    DAMAGED: Item damaged\r\n    EXPIRED_ITEM: Item expired\r\n    FAULTY_ITEM: Item defective\r\n    ITEM_MISSING: Item missing\r\n    STORE_PACKAGE_MISSING: Package missing\r\n    TRANSIT_PACKAGE_MISSING: Package missing\r\n    UNSUCCESSFUL_DELIVERY_UNDELIVERABLE: Package could not be delivered\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nReturn notifications","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9440567.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":38,"to":73}}}}],["75edf649-3d99-40a3-abfe-ab04c2f91375",{"pageContent":"STORE_PACKAGE_MISSING: Package missing\r\n    TRANSIT_PACKAGE_MISSING: Package missing\r\n    UNSUCCESSFUL_DELIVERY_UNDELIVERABLE: Package could not be delivered\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nReturn notifications\r\n\r\nWhen you enable return notifications, you’ll receive emails with consolidated updates on returns that require your action. You will receive the following types of notifications:\r\n\r\nReturn delivered notification\r\n\r\n\r\n  You’ll receive this notification when an order has been returned to your specified returns location. From here, you’ll need to process refunds, where relevant. If a refund isn't processed within 2 days, it may be processed automatically on your behalf and deducted from your merchant center account balance.\r\n\r\n\r\nPending return notifications\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pending return notification emails let you know that you have return tasks that are at SLA. Pending return notifications send you a daily email informing you of returns pending processing or pending return requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nOverdue return notifications\r\n\r\n\r\n  Outstanding return notifications email lets you know that you have return tasks that have passed SLA. Outstanding return notifications send you a daily email informing you of returns overdue processing or overdue return requests.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerforming your return actions within SLA is essential for your performance score on Buy on Google.

If your customer wishes to return a product ordered from you, you can decide to automatically issue a refund without requiring the product to be returned, or in other words, issue a “returnless refund”. This may help you save on shipping fees and other operational costs, and may be cheaper than having the customer return the product.\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nYou’ll be able to configure returnless refunds in your Merchant Center account. When a customer initiates a return for that product, it will be recognized as a returnless refund based on the price.

The ID allows you and Google to distinguish each collection. Remember that the ID [id] is unique to your collection and is different from the ID [id] used for products in your product feeds.\r\n  Use a stable ID for each collection. Once you've assigned an ID [id] to a collection, don't change it. The ID you choose identifies the collection and helps us to retrieve any associated collection-specific information. It is also used to track the associated collection's performance history in Merchant Center and Google Ads.

While collection IDs are case-sensitive in Merchant Center, there may be cases in which two collections with IDs that differ only by casing are interpreted as the same collection. For example, if you submit ID \"abc123\" for one collection and ID \"ABC123\" for another, these offers may be confused in Google Ads filtering or there could be issues matching them across supplemental and primary feeds. Instead of casing, use unique combinations of letters and numbers to differentiate collections.\r\n  Don't reuse or recycle the same ID for different collections. For example:\r\n    \r\n      Don't reuse an ID for different collections in the same country of sale or language.\r\n      Don't recycle an ID for new collections.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  Avoid white space. Consecutive white spaces and white spaces before and after the ID will be automatically removed.\r\n  Don't submit invalid unicode characters. These characters are generally added during your file's encoding process. To avoid them, use UTF-8 encoding. To help prevent encoding issues, submit files in a compressed format. Examples of invalid unicode characters include:\r\n    \r\n      Control characters (for example, U+200D)\r\n      Function characters\r\n      Private area characters\r\n      Surrogate pairs\r\n      Unassigned code points\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBest practices\r\n\r\nThese best practices can help you go beyond the basic requirements to optimize your collection data for performance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Use a meaningful string as the ID [id] for your collection.

For example, don’t link to a generic category page, your home page, or an individual product landing page. This landing page is where users are taken if they click on any part of the image that is not a product.\r\n  Ensure that your landing page is mobile friendly.

Make sure to use the domain name that you verified during account setup or through the Website Verification tab.

Learn more about Enabling Buy on Google for YouTube.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you sell products via Buy on Google, you’re responsible for issuing any required tax documents (for example, tax invoices) to the buyers. Instead of manually supplying these documents, automated VAT invoicing provides a streamlined way for you to provide invoice documents to customers who need them.\r\n\r\nBenefits\r\n\r\nThere are several reasons why a customer might request an invoice document:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Business customers may need an invoice stating the paid VAT amount for their own tax or accounting process.\r\n  Customers may want to file a warranty request to a manufacturer and need an invoice to prove ownership, source and date of purchase.\r\n  Customers may want to participate in cashback promotions that require the invoice as proof of ownership.\r\n  Customers may want to resell their purchased products and need the invoice as proof of ownership.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow it works\r\n\r\nIn order to use Automated VAT invoicing you'll need to:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Obtain the order-specific email address via the Order API attribute customer.invoiceReceivingEmail or via the Orders page in your Merchant Center account.\r\n  Send an email to that email address with the invoice attached to it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the email, it’s recommended that you send the invoice information in one of two ways:\r\n\r\n\r\n  In the invoice doc - attached as a .pdf attachment.\r\n  In the body of the email - in either a plain text or HTML format.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe invoice will be processed and made available for the customer in their order history.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Need help?

We organize and surface these products using unique product identifiers, or UPIs, so you can find your products by entering your product’s GTIN, UPC, EAN, JAN, or ISBN and customizing price, availability, tax, and shipping settings. Learn more about unique product identifiers\r\n\r\nAds and free listings for products submitted individually:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Are only available for Buy on Google\r\n  Cannot be combined with inventory feeds\r\n  Do not have an expiration date unless explicitly removed (unlike feed offers that expire in 30 days)\r\n  Cannot be affected by feed rules\r\n  Multi-client accounts are not eligible to use individual product data uploads.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore you begin\r\n\r\nWe recommend that you set up your tax and shipping settings before entering your products. You can toggle between basic and advanced. We recommend you set up tax and shipping settings at the account level.\r\n\r\nInstructions\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sign in to your Merchant Center account.\r\n  From the navigation panel, click Products and then All products.\r\n  Click the plus button .\r\n  Select the “Add catalog product” tab.\r\n  Enter the GTIN or other UPI for your product, and click Search catalog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Your target country and destinations data will be pre-filled and you won’t be able to edit it.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9698598.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":39}}}}],["4afd62a8-ddd6-4669-a407-84131ea079e7",{"pageContent":"Enter the GTIN or other UPI for your product, and click Search catalog.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Your target country and destinations data will be pre-filled and you won’t be able to edit it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Click either Yes, this is my product or No, search again.

Readable names or names that look like postal codes aren't accepted.\r\n  Avoid including an area code (such as a postal code, state, or oblast) in more than one region. If an overlap between 2 regions is detected, we will pick only one of the regional overrides to implement for that area. Up to 150 overrides can be supported for each product offer.\r\n  The currency used for a region must be the same as the currency used for the initial product offer.\r\n  Regions need to meet minimum geographic size and population requirements, and should ideally be geographically contiguous. Avoid adding unattached small area codes to a region. A small area code can be extended by clustering it with other area codes that surround it to make it larger. If the region doesn’t meet these size requirements, an error message will be shown in the “Issue” column on the \"Regions\" page.\r\n  If you have a physical warehouse or hub of delivery, we recommend that you use the corresponding region ID for associated products. This ensures that the correct price and availability are displayed to customers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Note: Your region eligibility may change over time as it's subject to population changes.

Since your online available products can be shipped to your stores, you can advertise the products along with the SLA on how long it will take to ship these products to all of your stores. For this feature to work, the product needs to be fulfillable online. This will allow Google to guarantee that the product can be transacted on.\r\n  \r\n\r\nBy using pickup later for Shopping ads in my Merchant Center account can I also advertise in-stock inventory?\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Products enabled through pickup later for Shopping ads only allow you to showcase products that can be picked up at your stores regardless of whether the item is in the store when the order is placed. Pickup later for Shopping ads doesn't allow you to advertise actual inventory within your stores. To be able to advertise through pickup later for Shopping ads, you will need to enable the local inventory ads program card within your Merchant Center account.

This means that if a product can be shipped to most of your stores within 3 days but for a few stores it can take up to 4 days, you need to submit the SLA for this product as “4-day”.

Instead, addition and deletion of products from Amazon-formatted feed files is controlled via Amazon feed attributes.\r\n\r\n      \r\n        Category-specific template files: Use the update delete [update_delete] attribute to add or delete products\r\n        Inventory loader files: Use the add delete [add_delete] attribute to add or delete products\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    Multiple file types per feed: Unlike Google feed files, Amazon-formatted feeds (for example, the category-specific template file, inventory loader file, and price and quantity file) are uploaded to the same, single feed.\r\n    Product data specification: Amazon feed specification is different from Merchant Center product data specification, and there are different attribute names and values. For example, Amazon product category-specific inventory templates differ from one product category to another. When uploading an Amazon category-specific template file, Merchant Center will automatically map the Amazon attributes to a Google equivalent, where possible.","metadata":{"source":"C:\\Users\\cbatten\\OneDrive - ROI Revolution\\Projects\\gmc-article-chatbot\\answers\\9975850.txt","loc":{"lines":{"from":27,"to":47}}}}],["65349101-b54f-4d30-98e9-57558567fb98",{"pageContent":"Because there are differences between the Google feed attributes and Amazon feed attributes, Google is unable to accurately map all Amazon feed attributes to Google attributes.

Then, you’ll be able to either provide a return shipping label directly in your Merchant Center account.\r\n\r\n    Google-facilitated returns\r\n\r\n    To have Google generate return labels automatically, you’ll need to link your supported shipping provider for return shipping.
